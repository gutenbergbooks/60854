<h2 id="c1">Preface</h2>
<p>The early part of the last century was an exciting time to live in
America. The signers of the Declaration of Independence and the framers
of the Constitution, mostly old men by now, saw that their experiment
in republican government had turned out to be a success. The
nation was flourishing in these years like a healthy adolescent. There
were growing pains, to be sure, but no one doubted now that the
youngster would reach manhood. The question was: What is he going
to be like?</p>
<p>The party battles of John Adams&rsquo; administration left the Federalist
Party in ruins, and Thomas Jefferson succeeded to the presidency with
an overwhelming popular mandate. During his first term, Jefferson increased
his popularity through buying from France the enormous Louisiana
Territory which doubled the size of the United States. By the time
the Lewis and Clark Expedition returned from exploring the new land,
people began to realize the immense possibilities that the Louisiana
Purchase held for the future of the United States.</p>
<p>Jefferson&rsquo;s second term was beset by foreign problems that culminated
eventually in the War of 1812, during James Madison&rsquo;s administration.
Despite George Washington&rsquo;s advice in his Farewell Address
to stay out of entangling foreign alliances, America could not avoid
being affected by events abroad. She was caught between the hammer
and the anvil during Napoleon&rsquo;s wars with the rest of Europe. The
War of 1812 settled no issues but, soon afterward, the main Anglo-American
problems left over from the Revolution were adjusted. Napoleon&rsquo;s
downfall at Waterloo removed France as an obstacle to American
development.</p>
<p>The period known as the &ldquo;Era of Good Feeling&rdquo; followed the War
of 1812. During the two terms of James Monroe, internal matters
were the main concern of the country: tariffs, banking, domestic improvements,
the admission of new states into the Union. With the Monroe
Doctrine, which warned Europe to respect the independence of Latin
America, the United States began to emerge as a power in the world.
Even more important was the appearance of storm warnings heralding
the eventual coming of the Civil War. The Missouri Compromise,
which drew a line between slave and free territory, established an
uneasy truce between the North and the South.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>By the time John Quincy Adams became the sixth President, sectionalism
was rapidly developing, and the balance of power between
the East and the West, the industrial North and the agricultural South,
was beginning to shift. The two-party system, which had largely disappeared
with the collapse of the Federalists in 1800, was revived. In
1828 the long monopoly that Virginia and Massachusetts had enjoyed
in supplying American Presidents came to an end with the election of
Andrew Jackson of Tennessee and a new era began.</p>
<p>The selections in this booklet reflect most of the significant events
of these years from 1801 to 1829. The Louisiana Purchase, the Lewis
and Clark Expedition, the War of 1812, the Missouri Compromise, all
are represented. In addition we have included accounts of some small
events and background descriptions which give the flavor of the age. A
proper notion of this period requires not only a knowledge of the major
issues, such as understanding the Embargo Act or the significance of
the <i>Marbury</i> vs. <i>Madison</i> decision, but also an appreciation of the quality
of the experience of being an American in the first quarter of the
nineteenth century. Hence we have used such documents as Lorenzo
Dow&rsquo;s diary describing the life of a frontier preacher and Morris Birkbeck&rsquo;s
account of settling in Illinois.</p>
<p>In editing the manuscripts in this booklet, we have followed the practice
of modernizing punctuation, capitalization, and spelling only when
necessary to make the selections clear. We have silently corrected misspelled
words and typographical errors. Wherever possible we have used
complete selections, but occasionally space limitations have made necessary
cuts in the original documents. Such cuts are indicated by spaced
periods. In general, the selections appear as the authors wrote them.</p>

<h2 id="c2">The Election and Inauguration</h2>
<p>On election day in 1800, Thomas Jefferson won a clear victory over
John Adams but almost did not became President. The Constitution required
that presidential electors cast two ballots; the winner became
President and the runner-up became Vice-President. Jefferson&rsquo;s running
mate, Aaron Burr, who had been nominated for Vice-President, received
73 electoral votes, the same number as Jefferson. This strange situation
occurred because the Constitutional Convention had not anticipated
the rise of party politics. When John Adams had defeated Jefferson in
1796, Jefferson, as the runner-up, was elected Vice-President. If parties
had not developed by 1800, Adams, as Jefferson&rsquo;s opponent, would
surely have become Vice-President. But because parties had arisen, all
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
of Jefferson&rsquo;s electors gave Burr their second vote. (A repetition of this
kind of deadlock was avoided for future elections by the Twelfth
Amendment.)</p>
<p>The Constitution stated that if the two leading candidates were
tied, the election should be decided by the House of Representatives.
The trouble was that in 1800 the House was controlled by the Federalists
and not by Jefferson&rsquo;s party. The Federalists nearly elected Burr
President because they disliked him less than they disliked Jefferson.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Margaret Bayard Smith Describes the Election and Inauguration</h3>
<p>Fortunately for the country, Federalist Alexander Hamilton, who
knew Burr was unfit to be President, opposed his party&rsquo;s plan to defeat
Jefferson. But while this crucial decision was being made, the nation
waited breathlessly. The excitement in Washington is recorded in the
following selection from the notebook of Margaret Bayard Smith, wife
of the editor of the <i>National Intelligencer</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> was an awful crisis. The people, who with such an overwhelming
majority had declared their will, would never peaceably
have allowed the man of their choice to be set aside and the individual
they had chosen as Vice-President to be put in his place. A
civil war must have taken place, to be terminated in all human
probability by a rupture of the Union. Such consequences were at
least calculated on and excited a deep and inflammatory interest.
Crowds of anxious spirits from the adjacent county and cities
thronged to the seat of government and hung like a thunder cloud
over the Capitol, their indignation ready to burst on any individual
who might be designated as President in opposition to the people&rsquo;s
known choice. The citizens of Baltimore, who from their proximity
were the first apprised of this daring design, were with difficulty
restrained from rushing on with an armed force, to prevent&mdash;or
if they could not prevent, to avenge this violation of the people&rsquo;s
will and in their own vehement language to hurl the usurper from
his seat.</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson, then President of the Senate, sitting in the midst
of these <i>conspirators</i>, as they were then called, unavoidably hearing
their loudly whispered designs, witnessing their gloomy and
restless machinations, aware of the dreadful consequences which
must follow their meditated designs, preserved through this trying
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
period the most unclouded serenity, the most perfect equanimity. A
spectator who watched his countenance would never have surmised
that he had any personal interest in the impending event. Calm
and self-possessed, he retained his seat in the midst of the angry
and stormy, though half-smothered passions that were struggling
around him, and by this dignified tranquility repressed any open
violence. Though insufficient to prevent whispered menaces and
insults, to these, however, he turned a deaf ear and resolutely
maintained a placidity which baffled the designs of his enemies.</p>
<p>The crisis was at hand. The two bodies of Congress met, the
Senators as witnesses, the Representatives as electors. The question
on which hung peace or war, nay, the union of the states was to be
decided. What an awful responsibility was attached to every vote
given on that occasion. The sitting was held with closed doors. It
lasted the whole day, the whole night. Not an individual left that
solemn assembly; the necessary refreshment they required was
taken in rooms adjoining the Hall. They were not like the Roman
conclave legally and forcibly confined; the restriction was self-imposed
from the deep-felt necessity of avoiding any extrinsic or
external influence. Beds, as well as food, were sent for the accommodation
of those whom age or debility disabled from enduring
such a long-protracted sitting. The balloting took place every hour&mdash;in
the interval men ate, drank, slept or pondered over the result
of the last ballot, compared ideas and persuasions to change
votes, or gloomily anticipated the consequences, let the result be
what it would.</p>
<p>With what an intense interest did every individual watch each
successive examination of the ballot-box; how breathlessly did they
listen to the counting of the votes! Every hour a messenger brought
to the editor of the <i>National Intelligencer</i> the result of the ballot.
That night I never lay down or closed my eyes. As the hour drew
near its close, my heart would almost audibly beat, and I was
seized with a tremour that almost disabled me from opening the
door for the expected messenger....</p>
<p>For more than thirty hours the struggle was maintained, but
finding the Republican phalanx impenetrable, not to be shaken in
their purpose, every effort proving unavailing, the Senator from
Delaware [<i>James A. Bayard&mdash;actually a Representative</i>], the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
withdrawal of whose vote would determine the issue, took his part,
gave up his party, for his country, and threw into the box a blank
ballot, thus leaving to the Republicans a majority. Mr. Jefferson
was declared duly elected. The assembled crowds, without the
Capitol, rent the air with their acclamations and gratulations, and
the conspirators, as they were called, hurried to their lodgings under
strong apprehensions of suffering from the just indignation of their
fellow citizens.</p>
<p>The dark and threatening cloud which had hung over the political
horizon rolled harmlessly away, and the sunshine of prosperity
and gladness broke forth and ever since, with the exception
of a few passing clouds, has continued to shine on our happy
country.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c4">Jefferson&rsquo;s First Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>As the author of the Declaration of Independence and many memorable
state papers, Thomas Jefferson was, with Abraham Lincoln, one of
our two greatest presidential writers. The following speech, which he
delivered on March 4, 1801, is an eloquent statement of democratic
principles. Jefferson approached the office of President with humility
and a conciliatory attitude towards his opponents. The simplicity and
directness of his prose contrast greatly with the flowery and lengthy
eloquence of most speakers in his day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends and Fellow Citizens:</p>
<p><span class="sc">Called</span> upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office
of our country, I avail myself of the presence of that portion
of my fellow citizens which is here assembled to express my grateful
thanks for the favor with which they have been pleased to look
towards me, to declare a sincere consciousness that the task is
above my talents and that I approach it with those anxious and
awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the
weakness of my powers so justly inspire.</p>
<p>A rising nation spread over a wide and fruitful land, traversing
all the seas with the rich productions of their industry, engaged in
commerce with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing
rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye; when I contemplate
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
these transcendent objects and see the honor, the happiness,
and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue
and the auspices of this day, I shrink from the contemplation and
humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking.</p>
<p>Utterly indeed should I despair, did not the presence of many
whom I here see remind me that in the other high authorities provided
by our Constitution, I shall find resources of wisdom, of virtue,
and of zeal, on which to rely under all difficulties.</p>
<p>To you then, gentlemen, who are charged with the sovereign
functions of legislation and to those associated with you, I look
with encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable
us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked
amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled sea.</p>
<p>During the contest of opinion through which we have passed,
the animation of discussions and of exertions, has sometimes worn
an aspect which might impose on strangers unused to think freely
and to speak and to write what they think.</p>
<p>But this being now decided by the voice of the nation, announced
according to the rules of the Constitution, all will of course
arrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in common
efforts for the common good. All too will bear in mind this sacred
principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail,
that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable: that the minority
possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect, and to
violate would be oppression.</p>
<p>Let us then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind;
let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection,
without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things.</p>
<p>And let us reflect that having banished from our land that religious
intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered
we have yet gained little, if we countenance a political intolerance
as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody
persecution.</p>
<p>During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world, during
the agonized spasms of infuriated man, seeking through blood and
slaughter his long lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the agitation
of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
shore; that this should be more felt and feared by some, and less
by others, and should divide opinions as to measures of safety.</p>
<p>But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.
We have called, by different names, brethren of the same principle.
We are all republicans: we are all federalists.</p>
<p>If there be any among us who wish to dissolve this union, or
to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed, as monuments
of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated
where reason is left free to combat it.</p>
<p>I know indeed that some honest men have feared that a republican
government cannot be strong; that this government is not
strong enough. But would the honest patriot, in the full tide of
successful experiment abandon a government which has so far
kept us free and firm, on the theoretic and visionary fear that this
government, the world&rsquo;s best hope may, by possibility, want energy
to preserve itself?</p>
<p>I trust not. I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest government
on earth.</p>
<p>I believe it the only one where every man, at the call of the
law, would fly to the standard of the law; would meet invasions of
public order, as his own personal concern.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government
of himself. Can he then be trusted with the government of
others? Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern
him? Let history answer this question.</p>
<p>Let us then pursue with courage and confidence our own federal
and republican principles, our attachment to union and representative
government.</p>
<p>Kindly separated by nature, and a wide ocean, from the exterminating
havoc of one quarter of the globe; too high-minded to
endure the degradations of the others; possessing a chosen country,
with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and
thousandth generation; entertaining a due sense of our equal right,
to the use of our own faculties, to the acquisitions of our own industry,
to honor and confidence from our fellow citizens resulting not
from birth, but from our actions and their sense of them, enlightened
by a benign religion, professed indeed and practiced in various
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty, truth, temperance,
gratitude, and the love of man, acknowledging and adoring an
overruling providence, which by all its dispensations proves that it
delights in the happiness of man here and his greater happiness
hereafter.</p>
<p>With all these blessings, what more is necessary to make us a
happy and a prosperous people? Still one thing more, fellow citizens,
a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from
injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate
their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take
from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.</p>
<p>This is the sum of good government, and this is necessary to
close the circle of our felicities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c5">Burr Kills Hamilton</h2>
<p>The feud between Hamilton and Burr preceded the election of 1800,
in which Hamilton opposed Burr&rsquo;s election to the presidency. The
rivalry between these two New Yorkers actually had begun during the
Revolution and had continued throughout their political careers, but it
reached a special intensity in 1800. As Vice-President under Jefferson,
Burr had reached the peak of his career, but Jefferson, realizing that
Burr almost had schemed his way into the presidency, undermined his
influence in the Republican Party. In 1804, Hamilton again thwarted
Burr&rsquo;s ambitions by helping to defeat him for governor of New York.
The duel soon followed.</p>
<p>Hamilton had no intention of firing at Burr and seems to have expected
to die, for he made his will and arranged his affairs before
crossing the Hudson River to New Jersey for the fatal duel on July 11,
1804. Burr had great charm and undenied ability, but it might have
been better for him if he had died that day instead of Hamilton. He
was an unscrupulous intriguer, and his subsequent career tarnished his
reputation. In 1805, he tried to establish a political empire in the Mississippi
Valley but he was captured and tried for treason. Though he
was acquitted, he had to spend the next four years in exile. He later
returned to an obscure law practice in New York.</p>
<h3 id="c6">David Hosack Describes Hamilton&rsquo;s Last Hours</h3>
<p>In the selection that follows, David Hosack, the physician who attended
Hamilton at the duel, describes the scene immediately after Burr
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
fired the fatal shot. He writes to William Coleman, editor of the New
York <i>Post</i>, the paper Hamilton had founded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">To</span> comply with your request is a painful task; but I will repress
my feelings while I endeavor to furnish you with an enumeration
of such particulars relative to the melancholy end of our beloved
friend Hamilton, as dwell most forcibly on my recollection.</p>
<p>When called to him, upon his receiving the fatal wound, I
found him half sitting on the ground, supported in the arms of
Mr. Pendleton. His countenance of death I shall never forget. He
had at that instant just strength to say, &ldquo;This is a mortal wound,
Doctor&rdquo;; when he sunk away, and became to all appearance lifeless.
I immediately stripped up his clothes, and soon, alas! ascertained
that the direction of the ball must have been through some
vital part. His pulses were not to be felt; his respiration was entirely
suspended; and upon laying my hand on his heart, and perceiving
no motion there, I considered him as irrecoverably gone.
I however observed to Mr. Pendleton that the only chance for his
reviving was immediately to get him upon the water.</p>
<p>We therefore lifted him up, and carried him out of the wood,
to the margin of the bank, where the bargemen aided us in conveying
him into the boat, which immediately put off. During all this
time I could not discover the least symptom of returning life. I now
rubbed his face, lips, and temples, with spirits of hartshorn, applied
it to his neck and breast, and to the wrists and palms of his hands,
and endeavored to pour some into his mouth. When we had got,
as I should judge, about fifty yards from the shore, some imperfect
efforts to breathe were for the first time manifest. In a few minutes
he sighed, and became sensible to the impression of the hartshorn,
or the fresh air of the water. He breathed; his eyes, hardly opened,
wandered, without fixing upon any objects. To our great joy he at
length spoke: &ldquo;My vision is indistinct,&rdquo; were his first words. His
pulse became more perceptible; his respiration more regular; his
sight returned.</p>
<p>... Soon after recovering his sight, he happened to cast his
eye upon the case of pistols, and observing the one that he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
had in his hand lying on the outside, he said, &ldquo;Take care of that
pistol; it is undischarged, and still cocked; it may go off and do
harm.&mdash;<i>Pendleton knows</i> (attempting to turn his head towards
him) <i>that I did not intend to fire at him</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Pendleton,
understanding his wish, &ldquo;I have already made Dr. Hosack
acquainted with your determination as to that.&rdquo;... Perceiving
that we approached the shore, he said, &ldquo;Let Mrs. Hamilton be immediately
sent for. Let the event be gradually broken to her; but
give her hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking up, we saw his friend Mr. Bayard standing on the
wharf in great agitation. He had been told by his servant that
General Hamilton, Mr. Pendleton, and myself, had crossed the river
in a boat together, and too well he conjectured the fatal errand,
and foreboded the dreadful result. Perceiving, as we came nearer,
that Mr. Pendleton and myself only sat up in the stern sheets, he
clasped his hands together in the most violent apprehension; but
when I called to him to have a cot prepared, and he at the same
moment saw his poor friend lying in the bottom of the boat, he
threw up his eyes and burst into a flood of tears and lamentation.
Hamilton alone appeared tranquil and composed. We then conveyed
him as tenderly as possible up to the house. The distresses of
this amiable family were such that till the first shock was abated,
they were scarcely able to summon fortitude enough to yield sufficient
assistance to their dying friend.</p>
<p>... During the night he had some imperfect sleep; but the
succeeding morning his symptoms were aggravated, attended,
however, with a diminution of pain. His mind retained all its usual
strength and composure. The great source of his anxiety seemed
to be in his sympathy with his half-distracted wife and children.
He spoke to her frequently of them. &ldquo;My beloved wife and children,&rdquo;
were always his expressions. But his fortitude triumphed
over his situation, dreadful as it was. Once, indeed, at the sight of
his children brought to the bedside together, seven in number, his
utterance forsook him. He opened his eyes, gave them one look,
and closed them again till they were taken away. As a proof of his
extraordinary composure of mind, let me add that he alone could
calm the frantic grief of their mother. &ldquo;<i>Remember, my Eliza, you
are a Christian</i>,&rdquo; were the expressions with which he frequently,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
with a firm voice, but in a pathetic and impressive manner, addressed
her. His words, and the tone in which they were uttered,
will never be effaced from my memory. At about two o&rsquo;clock, as
the public well knows, he expired.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c7">Marbury vs. Madison</h2>
<p>The duel between the former Secretary of the Treasury and the
Vice-President provided high drama, but far more important was an
event that had occurred the year before in Washington. This event was
a Supreme Court decision written by Chief Justice Marshall, the decision
known as <i>Marbury</i> vs. <i>Madison</i>. It established the principle that the
Supreme Court may declare unconstitutional any law passed by Congress
that conflicts with the Constitution. This principle has become
so well accepted today that we can hardly realize it ever had to be
stated. Its effect, however, was to strengthen the system of checks
and balances between the three main branches of our government.</p>
<p>Marbury was an obscure justice of the peace, appointed by President
Adams just before his term expired. The lame-duck Federalist
administration went out of office before Marbury received his commission,
and Marbury appealed to the Supreme Court to force James
Madison, the new Secretary of State, to give it to him. The Supreme
Court declared that Marbury deserved his commission but that it could
not grant it. The reason was that the law saying the Court could do this
was contrary to the Constitution and therefore invalid. In the portion of
the decision that follows, Chief Justice Marshall argues the principle that
Congress may not give powers not specifically authorized by the Constitution
to the courts or to anyone else.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Excerpts from John Marshall&rsquo;s Decision</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> question whether an act, repugnant [<i>opposed</i>] to the
Constitution, can become the law of the land is a question deeply
interesting to the United States but, happily, not of an intricacy
proportioned to its interest. It seems only necessary to recognize
certain principles, supposed to have been long and well established,
to decide it.</p>
<p>That the people have an original right to establish, for their
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
future government, such principles as, in their opinion, shall most
conduce to their own happiness is the basis on which the whole
American fabric has been erected. The exercise of this original
right is a very great exertion; nor can it, nor ought it, to be frequently
repeated. The principles, therefore, so established are
deemed fundamental. And as the authority from which they proceed
is supreme, and can seldom act, they are designed to be
permanent.</p>
<p>This original and supreme will organizes the government and
assigns to different departments their respective powers. It may
either stop here or establish certain limits not to be transcended by
those departments.</p>
<p>The government of the United States is of the latter description.
The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and
that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the Constitution
is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose
is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may, at
any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction
between a government with limited and unlimited powers
is abolished if those limits do not confine the persons on whom
they are imposed, and if acts prohibited and acts allowed are of
equal obligation. It is a proposition too plain to be contested that
the Constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it or that
the legislature may alter the Constitution by an ordinary act.</p>
<p>Between these alternatives there is no middle ground. The
Constitution is either a superior paramount law, unchangeable by
ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts
and, like other acts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to
alter it.</p>
<p>If the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative
act contrary to the Constitution is not law; if the latter part be
true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts, on the part of
the people, to limit a power in its own nature illimitable.</p>
<p>Certainly, all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate
them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of
the nation, and, consequently, the theory of every such government
must be, that an act of the legislature repugnant to the Constitution
is void.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Marshall goes on to refute the argument that the Supreme Court
should concern itself only with interpreting the law, regardless of the
Constitution. Then he quotes specific passages from the Constitution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> is declared that &ldquo;no tax or duty shall be laid on articles
exported from any state.&rdquo; Suppose a duty on the export of cotton,
of tobacco, or of flour; and a suit instituted to recover it. Ought
judgment to be rendered in such a case? Ought the judges to close
their eyes on the Constitution and only see the law?...</p>
<p>&ldquo;No person,&rdquo; says the Constitution, &ldquo;shall be convicted of treason,
unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same <i>overt</i>
act, or on confession in open court.&rdquo; Here the language of the
Constitution is addressed especially to the courts. It prescribes directly
for them, a rule of evidence not to be departed from. If the
legislature should change that rule and declare one witness, or a
confession out of court, sufficient for conviction, must the constitutional
principle yield to the legislative act?</p>
<p>From these, and many other selections which might be made,
it is apparent that the framers of the Constitution contemplated that
instrument as a rule for the government of <i>courts</i> as well as of the
legislature.</p>
<p>Why otherwise does it direct the judges to take an oath to support
it? This oath certainly applies in an especial manner to their
conduct in their official character. How immoral to impose it on
them if they were to be used as the instruments, and the knowing
instruments, for violating what they swear to support!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the decision the Chief Justice concluded that the
language of the Constitution confirmed and strengthened the principle
essential to all written constitutions &ldquo;that a law repugnant to the
Constitution is void.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c9">The Louisiana Purchase</h2>
<p>The great event of Jefferson&rsquo;s first term was the acquisition of the
Louisiana Territory, that vast tract of land extending from the Mississippi
River to the Rocky Mountains, from the Canadian border to the Gulf of
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Mexico. The purchase of this land from Napoleon was not a premeditated
act but rather the result of seizing an opportunity that presented
itself. President Jefferson started out merely to buy New Orleans from
France but ended up with more than 800,000 square miles. The agreed-on
price was about $15,000,000, or something like two cents per acre.</p>
<p>Napoleon had forced Spain to give Louisiana back to France after
Spain had held the territory nearly forty years. Just before the letter in
the following account was written, the Spanish Intendant (director) of
New Orleans, who had not yet turned over the city to France, closed
the port to American commerce. Because most of the produce of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys reached eastern and foreign markets via
New Orleans, closing the port seemed almost an act of war against
the United States. At this point Jefferson sent James Monroe to Europe
as special minister to buy New Orleans. It turned out just then that
Napoleon needed money to renew his war against England, and the
entire territory was purchased within a few weeks. The events which
led to the purchase are described in the following letter that Jefferson
wrote on February 3, 1803, to Robert Livingston, the American minister
to France.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Jefferson Writes to Robert Livingston</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">A late</span> suspension by the Intendant of New Orleans of our
right of deposit there, without which the right of navigation is impracticable,
has thrown this country into such a flame of hostile
disposition as can scarcely be described. The western country was
peculiarly sensible to it as you may suppose. Our business was to
take the most effectual pacific measures in our power to remove
the suspension, and at the same time to persuade our countrymen
that pacific measures would be the most effectual and the most
speedily so. The opposition caught it as a plank in a shipwreck,
hoping it would enable them to tack the western people to them.
They raised the cry of war, were intriguing in all the quarters to
exasperate the western inhabitants to arm and go down on their
own authority and possess themselves of New Orleans, and in the
meantime were daily reiterating, in new shapes, inflammatory
resolutions for the adoption of the House.</p>
<p>As a remedy to all this we determined to name a minister
extraordinary to go immediately to Paris and Madrid to settle this
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
matter. This measure being a visible one, and the person named
peculiarly proper with the western country, crushed at once and
put an end to all further attempts on the Legislature. From that
moment all has become quiet; and the more readily in the western
country, as the sudden alliance of these new federal friends had
of itself already began to make them suspect the wisdom of their
own course. The measure was moreover proposed from another
cause. We must know at once whether we can acquire New Orleans
or not. We are satisfied nothing else will secure us against a
war at no distant period; and we cannot press this reason without
beginning those arrangements which will be necessary if war is
hereafter to result.</p>
<p>For this purpose it was necessary that the negotiators should
be fully possessed of every idea we have on the subject, so as to
meet the propositions of the opposite party, in whatever form they
may be offered; and give them a shape admissible by us without
being obliged to await new instructions hence. With this view, we
have joined Mr. Monroe to yourself at Paris, and to Mr. Pinckney
at Madrid, although we believe it will be hardly necessary for him
to go to this last place.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c11">The Lewis and Clark Expedition</h3>
<p>Exploring the Missouri River Valley and the Rocky Mountain area
long had been a cherished project of President Jefferson. He had
talked about it periodically since the Revolution, and when he became
President he set about to make his dream come true. Even before the
United States owned the Louisiana Territory, Capt. Meriwether Lewis,
Jefferson&rsquo;s secretary, and William Clark, younger brother of George
Rogers Clark, had been picked to head an expedition to explore the
West.</p>
<p>The journey did not begin, however, until May, 1804, when the
expedition left St. Louis. Capt. Lewis led his explorers up the Missouri
River to what is now North Dakota, and before cold weather set in
they built huts and a stockade for winter quarters. The next spring
they moved on up the river in dugout canoes (pirogues) towards the
mountains. The following selection from Capt. Lewis&rsquo; journal of the expedition
was set down on April 13, 1805, when the party was at the junction
of the Missouri and the Little Missouri rivers, still in North Dakota.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p><span class="sc">Being</span> disappointed in my observations of yesterday for longitude,
I was unwilling to remain at the entrance of the river another
day for that purpose, and therefore determined to set out early this
morning; which we did accordingly; the wind was in our favour
after 9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> and continued favourable until 3 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> We therefore
hoisted both the sails in the White Pirogue, consisting of a small
square sail and spritsail, which carried her at a pretty good gait,
until about 2 in the afternoon when a sudden squall of wind struck
us and turned the pirogue so much on the side as to alarm Charbonneau
[<i>the interpreter</i>], who was steering at the time. In this
state of alarm he threw the pirogue with her side to the wind, when
the spritsail gibing was as near oversetting the pirogue as it was
possible to have missed. The wind, however, abating for an instant,
I ordered Drouillard [<i>also an interpreter</i>] to the helm and the
sails to be taken in, which was instantly executed, and the pirogue
being steered before the wind was again placed in a state of security.
This accident was very near costing us dearly. Believing this
vessel to be the most steady and safe, we had embarked on board
of it our instruments, papers, medicine, and the most valuable part
of the merchandise which we had still in reserve as presents for
the Indians. We had also embarked on board ourselves, with three
men who could not swim, and the squaw [<i>Sacajawea, the Shoshone
wife of Charbonneau, who showed the party the way across the
Continental Divide and obtained horses and protection for them
from the Shoshones</i>] with the young child, all of whom, had the
pirogue overset, would most probably have perished, as the waves
were high, and the pirogue upwards of 200 yards from the nearest
shore; however, we fortunately escaped and pursued our journey
under the square sail, which shortly after the accident I directed
to be again hoisted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the end of May the expedition had moved halfway across Montana,
still following the Missouri River:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Today</span> we passed on the starboard [<i>right</i>] side the remains of
a vast many mangled carcasses of buffalo which had been driven
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
over a precipice of 120 feet by the Indians and perished; the water
appeared to have washed away a part of this immense pile of
slaughter and still there remained the fragments of at least a hundred
carcasses. They created a most horrid stench. In this manner
the Indians of the Missouri destroy vast herds of buffalo at a
stroke; for this purpose one of the most active and fleet young men
is selected and disguised in a robe of buffalo skin, having also the
skin of the buffalo&rsquo;s head with the ears and horns fastened on his
head in form of a cap. Thus caparisoned he places himself at a
convenient distance between a herd of buffalo and a precipice
proper for the purpose, which happens in many places on this
river for miles together; the other Indians now surround the herd
on the back and flanks, and at a signal agreed on all show themselves
at the same time moving forward towards the buffalo.</p>
<p>The disguised Indian or decoy has taken care to place himself
sufficiently nigh the buffalo to be noticed by them when they take
to flight, and running before them they follow him in full speed to
the precipice, the cattle behind driving those in front over and seeing
them go do not look or hesitate about following until the whole
are precipitated down the precipice forming one common mass of
dead and mangled carcasses. The decoy in the meantime has taken
care to secure himself in some cranny or crevice of the cliff which
he had previously prepared for that purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By August 13 the expedition was crossing the Continental Divide at
Lemhi Pass on the border between Montana and Idaho. In the selection
that follows, Capt. Lewis describes the party&rsquo;s meeting with the Shoshone
Indians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> had not continued our route more than a mile when we
were so fortunate as to meet with three female savages. The short
and steep ravines which we passed concealed us from each other
until we arrived within 30 paces. A young woman immediately
took to flight; an elderly woman and a girl of about 12 years old
remained. I instantly laid by my gun and advanced towards them.
They appeared much alarmed but saw that we were too near for
them to escape by flight; they therefore seated themselves on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
ground, holding down their heads as if reconciled to die, which
they expected no doubt would be their fate. I took the elderly
woman by the hand and raised her up, repeated the word <i>tab-ba-bone</i>
and stripped up my shirt sleeve to show her my skin; to prove
to her the truth of the assertion that I was a white man, for my
face and hands, which have been constantly exposed to the sun,
were quite as dark as their own. They appeared instantly reconciled,
and the men coming up, I gave these women some beads, a
few moccasin awls, some pewter looking-glasses, and a little paint.</p>
<p>I directed Drouillard to request the old woman to recall the
young woman who had run off to some distance by this time, fearing
she might alarm the camp before we approached and might so
exasperate the natives that they would perhaps attack us without
enquiring who we were. The old woman did as she was requested
and the fugitive soon returned almost out of breath. I bestowed an
equivalent portion of trinket on her with the others. I now painted
their tawny cheeks with some vermillion, which with this nation is
emblematic of peace. After they had become composed I informed
them by signs that I wished them to conduct us to their camp, that
we were anxious to become acquainted with the chiefs and warriors
of their nation. They readily obeyed and we set out, still pursuing
the road down the river.</p>
<p>We had marched about 2 miles when we met a party of about
60 warriors mounted on excellent horses, who came in nearly full
speed. When they arrived, I advanced towards them with the flag,
leaving my gun with the party about 50 paces behind me. The
chief and two others who were a little in advance of the main body
spoke to the women, and they informed them who we were and
exultingly showed the presents which had been given them. These
men then advanced and embraced me very affectionately in their
way, which is by putting their left arm over your right shoulder,
clasping your back, while they apply their left cheek to yours and
frequently vociferate the word <i>ah-hi-e, ah-hi-e</i>, that is, I am much
pleased, I am much rejoiced. Both parties now advanced and we
were all caressed and besmeared with their grease and paint till I
was heartily tired of the national hug.</p>
<p>I now had the pipe lit and gave them smoke; they seated themselves
in a circle around us and pulled off their moccasins before
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
they would receive or smoke the pipe. This is a custom among
them, as I afterwards learned, indicative of a sacred obligation of
sincerity in their profession of friendship, given by the act of receiving
and smoking the pipe of a stranger. Or which is as much as
to say that they wish they may always go barefoot if they are not
sincere; a pretty heavy penalty if they are to march through the
plains of their country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After crossing the Continental Divide, the expedition descended the
Columbia River to the Pacific Coast, where they built a fort and spent
the winter of 1805-1806. The next year they retraced their steps across
the wilderness and returned to St. Louis in September, 1806, having
been gone twenty-eight months. The expedition not only was a great
adventure, but it also captured the imagination of the country. Not long
afterwards fur traders began tapping the rich resources of the area,
and by the middle of the century settlers were crossing the plains and
mountains via the Oregon Trail.</p>
<h2 id="c12">The Embargo Act</h2>
<p>Although Jefferson was re-elected in 1804 by a landslide victory,
his popularity diminished greatly during his second term. The source of
his troubles lay in Europe, where England and France were involved in
the long, bitter Napoleonic Wars. England could not defeat Napoleon
on land, but her navy was superior. Hence she blockaded the continent.
France retaliated by counter-blockades. The United States, with a large
merchant fleet but scarcely any navy, was caught in the middle. Hundreds
of American ships were seized and their cargoes confiscated.
Both England and France violated American neutral rights, but England,
with the world&rsquo;s strongest navy, was the chief offender. When a British
warship, the <i>Leopard</i>, fired on and impressed American seamen from
an American frigate, the <i>Chesapeake</i>, off the coast of Virginia, the
United States was ready to fight.</p>
<p>President Jefferson, however, was determined to avoid war and answered
the <i>Chesapeake</i> incident with a proclamation excluding British
warships from American waters, but the British would not agree to stop
impressing American seamen. In addition, to deal with the seizure of
American ships, Jefferson persuaded Congress to pass the Embargo Act.
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
This act forbade American ships to leave for foreign ports. The result
was that American ships rotted in the harbors and depression hit American
business. Yet England and France were not hurt enough to come
to terms. The Embargo Act had to be repealed.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Washington Irving Satirizes the Embargo Act</h3>
<p>About the time the Embargo Act was repealed, Washington Irving,
America&rsquo;s first important man of letters, wrote his <i>History of New York</i>.
This book is a burlesque account of the old Dutch period in New York
history, a very funny book, full of comic pictures of the Dutch governors
and the early settlers. The book also contains some contemporary political
satire in the chapters devoted to William the Testy. In the selections
which follow you will see obvious references to the <i>Chesapeake</i>
incident, the Embargo Act, and President Jefferson&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">As</span> my readers are well aware of the advantage a potentate
has in handling his enemies as he pleases in his speeches and bulletins,
where he has the talk all on his own side, they may rest
assured that William the Testy did not let such an opportunity
escape of giving the Yankees what is called &ldquo;a taste of his quality.&rdquo;
In speaking of their inroads into the territories of their High Mightinesses,
he compared them to the Gauls who desolated Rome, the
Goths and Vandals who overran the fairest plains of Europe; but
when he came to speak of the unparalleled audacity with which
they of Weathersfield had advanced their [<i>onion</i>] patches up to
the very walls of Fort Goed Hoop, and threatened to smother the
garrison in onions, tears of rage started into his eyes, as though
he nosed the very offense in question.</p>
<p>Having thus wrought up his tale to a climax, he assumed a
most belligerent look, and assured the council that he had devised
an instrument, potent in its effects, and which he trusted would
soon drive the Yankees from the land. So saying, he thrust his
hand into one of the deep pockets of his broad-skirted coat and
drew forth, not an infernal machine, but an instrument in writing,
which he laid with great emphasis upon the table.</p>
<p>The burghers gazed at it for a time in silent awe, as a wary
housewife does at a gun, fearful it may go off half-cocked. The
document in question had a sinister look, it is true; it was crabbed
in text, and from a broad red ribbon dangled the great seal of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
province, about the size of a buckwheat pancake. Still, after all,
it was but an instrument in writing. Herein, however, existed the
wonder of the invention. The document in question was a
PROCLAMATION, ordering the Yankees to depart instantly
from the territories of their High Mightinesses, under pain of suffering
all the forfeitures and punishments in such case made and
provided. It was on the moral effect of this formidable instrument
that Wilhelmus Kieft calculated, pledging his valor as a governor
that, once fulminated [<i>thundered</i>] against the Yankees, it would
in less than two months drive every mother&rsquo;s son of them across
the borders.</p>
<p>The council broke up in perfect wonder, and nothing was
talked of for some time among the old men and women of New
Amsterdam but the vast genius of the governor and his new and
cheap mode of fighting by proclamation.</p>
<p>As to Wilhelmus Kieft, having dispatched his proclamation to
the frontiers, he put on his cocked hat and corduroy small clothes,
and, mounting a tall rawboned charger, trotted out to his rural retreat
of Dog&rsquo;s Misery....</p>
<p>Never was a more comprehensive, a more expeditious&mdash;or,
what is still better, a more economical&mdash;measure devised than
this of defeating the Yankees by proclamation&mdash;an expedient,
likewise, so gentle and humane there were ten chances to one in
favor of its succeeding, but then there was one chance to ten that
it would not succeed: as the ill-natured Fates would have it, that
single chance carried the day! The proclamation was perfect in all
its parts, well constructed, well written, well sealed, and well published;
all that was wanting to insure its effect was, that the Yankees
should stand in awe of it; but, provoking to relate, they treated
it with the most absolute contempt, applied it to an unseemly purpose,
and thus did the first warlike proclamation come to a shameful
end&mdash;a fate which I am credibly informed has befallen but
too many of its successors.</p>
<p>So far from abandoning the country, those varlets [<i>rascals</i>]
continued their encroachments, squatting along the green banks of
the Varsche River, and founding Hartford, Stamford, New Haven,
and other border towns. I have already shown how the onion
patches of Pyquag were an eyesore to Jacobus Van Curlet and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
garrison; but now these moss-troopers increased in their atrocities,
kidnaping hogs, impounding horses, and sometimes grievously rib-roasting
their owners. Our worthy forefathers could scarcely stir
abroad without danger of being outjockeyed in horseflesh or taken
in in bargaining, while in their absence some daring Yankee peddler
would penetrate to their household and nearly ruin the good
housewives with tinware and wooden bowls....</p>
<p>It was long before William the Testy could be persuaded that
his much-vaunted war measure was ineffectual; on the contrary,
he flew in a passion whenever it was doubted, swearing that though
slow in operating, yet when it once began to work it would soon
purge the land of these invaders. When convinced, at length, of
the truth, like a shrewd physician he attributed the failure to the
quantity, not the quality, of the medicine, and resolved to double
the dose. He fulminated, therefore, a second proclamation, more
vehement than the first, forbidding all intercourse with these Yankee
intruders, ordering the Dutch burghers on the frontiers to buy
none of their pacing horses, measly port, apple sweetmeats, Weathersfield
onions, or wooden bowls, and to furnish them with no supplies
of gin, gingerbread, or sauerkraut.</p>
<p>Another interval elapsed, during which the last proclamation
was as little regarded as the first, and the non-intercourse was
especially set at naught by the young folks of both sexes, if we
may judge by the active bundling which took place along the
borders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Irving concludes this satire of William the Testy&rsquo;s proclamation by
a comic account of how the Yankees captured Fort Goed Hoop. They
sneaked into the fort while the Dutch soldiers were sleeping off their
dinner, gave the defenders a kick in the pants, and sent them back
to New Amsterdam.</p>

<h3 id="c15">Madison&rsquo;s Inauguration</h3>
<p>Despite the unpopularity of the Embargo Act, James Madison, Jefferson&rsquo;s
choice to succeed him in the presidency, was elected by a
large margin. Madison had served a long career in public life, beginning
with the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention
and more recently serving as Secretary of State under Jefferson. In the
following selection Margaret Bayard Smith again reports the Washington
scene, this time the events of March 4, 1809, Inauguration Day.
Note that she mixes up the sequence of events by starting with the
reception after the inauguration before describing the inauguration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Today</span> after the inauguration we all went to Mrs. Madison&rsquo;s.
The street was full of carriages and people, and we had to wait
near half an hour before we could get in&mdash;the house was completely
filled, parlours, entry, drawing room and bed room. Near
the door of the drawing room Mr. and Mrs. Madison stood to receive
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
their company. She looked extremely beautiful, was dressed
in a plain cambric dress with a very long train, plain round the
neck without any handkerchief, and beautiful bonnet of purple
velvet, and white satin with white plumes. She was all dignity,
grace and affability.</p>
<p>Mr. Madison shook my hand with all the cordiality of old acquaintance,
but it was when I saw our dear and venerable Mr.
Jefferson that my heart beat. When he saw me, he advanced from
the crowd, took my hand affectionately, and held it five or six minutes;
one of the first things he said was, &ldquo;Remember the promise
you have made me, to come to see us next summer; do not forget
it,&rdquo; said he, pressing my hand, &ldquo;for we shall certainly expect you.&rdquo;
I assured him I would not, and told him I could now wish him joy
with much more sincerity than this day 8 years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have now resigned a heavy burden,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and am much happier at this moment
than my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd was immense both at the Capitol and here; thousands
and thousands of people thronged the avenue. The Capitol
presented a gay scene. Every inch of space was crowded and there
being as many ladies as gentlemen, all in full dress, it gave it rather
a gay than a solemn appearance&mdash;there was an attempt made to
appropriate particular seats for the ladies of public characters, but
it was found impossible to carry it into effect, for the sovereign
people would not resign their privileges and the high and low were
promiscuously blended on the floor and in the galleries. Mr.
Madison was extremely pale and trembled excessively when
he first began to speak, but soon gained confidence and spoke
audibly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Smith now interrupts her letter (to her sister-in-law) and finishes
it the next day. The event she describes is the inauguration ball at
Long&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Last</span> evening, I endeavored calmly to look on, and amidst the
noise, bustle and crowd, to spend an hour or two in sober reflection,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
but my eye was always fixed on our venerable friend [<i>Jefferson</i>].
When he approached my ear listened to catch every word,
and when he spoke to me my heart beat with pleasure. Personal
attachment produces this emotion, and I did not blame it.
But I have not this regard for Mr. Madison, and I was displeased
at feeling no emotion when he came up and conversed with me.
He made some of his old kind of mischievous allusions, and I told
him I found him still unchanged. I tried in vain to feel merely as
a spectator; the little vanities of my nature often conquered my
better reason.</p>
<p>The room was so terribly crowded that we had to stand on the
benches; from this situation we had a view of the moving mass;
for it was nothing else. It was scarcely possible to elbow your way
from one side to another, and poor Mrs. Madison was almost
pressed to death, for every one crowded round her, those behind
pressing on those before, and peeping over their shoulders to have
a peep of her, and those who were so fortunate as to get near
enough to speak to her were happy indeed. As the upper sashes
of the windows could not let down, the glass was broken, to ventilate
the room, the air of which had become oppressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c16">The War of 1812</h2>
<p>The War of 1812, like the Korean war of this century, was a conflict
that neither side won. The young United States Navy scored some
notable victories at sea but could not prevent the overwhelming naval
power of the British from blockading American coasts and cutting off
American commerce. The United States Army, with a few notable exceptions,
was badly generaled and was outfought. General Hull surrendered
Detroit without a fight, and General Dearborn, who set out
to attack Montreal, marched to the Canadian border, lost his nerve, and
turned back.</p>
<p>The War of 1812 was also like the Korean war in that it was
unpopular with the political party out of office. Federalist New England
refused to support it, calling the conflict &ldquo;Mr. Madison&rsquo;s War,&rdquo; and
seriously talked of secession. New England merchants traded with the
enemy, and when Maine was occupied by the British, many Americans
quickly took an oath of allegiance to the king. The Czar of Russia&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
offer to act as mediator between England and America was eagerly
accepted. The peace talks, however, dragged on for nearly two years
before a settlement, leaving things just as they were before the war,
was agreed upon.</p>
<p>Although neither side won, the War of 1812 did have some important
consequences. Historians see it as America&rsquo;s second war for independence.
The Revolution severed American ties with England. The
War of 1812 removed any doubts in the minds of European powers
that the United States was here to stay. Also, in the years following
the war, America was able to settle her grievances with England and
to force the Spanish out of Florida. And, for the first time, the United
States could concentrate on internal problems.</p>
<h3 id="c17">The Constitution Defeats the Guerri&egrave;re</h3>
<p>The frigate <i>Constitution</i>, captained by Isaac Hull, already had a
distinguished history when the War of 1812 began. She had been built
in Boston during the trouble with France in 1797 and had taken part
in the war with the Barbary pirates. The peace treaty with Tripoli had
been signed in the captain&rsquo;s quarters on the gun deck. A trim, fast,
graceful ship, the frigate had been made from timbers of solid live
oak, hard pine, and red cedar. The bolts, copper sheathing, and brass-work
had been supplied by Paul Revere. This ship now is preserved
as a museum at the Boston Navy Yard.</p>
<p>Congress declared war on England in June, 1812, and the next
month Capt. Hull sailed from Chesapeake Bay. In August he encountered
the British ship <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, and the action that followed he reports in
his dispatch to the Secretary of the Navy. Thus, the war began with a
resounding sea victory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p><span class="sc">I have</span> the honour to inform you, that on the 19th instant, at
2 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> being in latitude 41, 42, longitude 55, 48, with the <i>Constitution</i>
under my command, a sail was discovered from the masthead
bearing E. by S. or E.S.E. but at such a distance we could
not tell what she was. All sail was instantly made in chase, and
soon found we came up with her. At 3 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> could plainly see that
she was a ship on the starboard tack, under easy sail, close on a
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
wind; at half past 3 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> made her out to be a frigate; continued
the chase until we were within about three miles, when I ordered
the light sails taken in, the courses hauled up, and the ship cleared
for action. At this time the chase had backed his main top-sail,
waiting for us to come down.</p>
<p>As soon as the <i>Constitution</i> was ready for action, I bore down
with an intention to bring him to close action immediately; but on
our coming within gunshot she gave us a broadside and filled away,
and wore, giving us a broadside on the other tack, but without
effect; her shot falling short. She continued wearing and maneuvering
for about three-quarters of an hour, to get a raking position,
but finding she could not, she bore up, and ran under top-sails and
gib, with the wind on the quarter.</p>
<p>I immediately made sail to bring the ship up with her, and
5 minutes before 6 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> being along side within half pistol shot, we
commenced a heavy fire from all our guns, double shotted with
round and grape, and so well directed were they, and so warmly
kept up, that in 15 minutes his mizen-mast went by the board, and
his main-yard in the slings, and the hull, rigging, and sails very
much torn to pieces. The fire was kept up with equal warmth for
15 minutes longer, when his main-mast, and fore-mast went, taking
with them every spar, excepting the bowsprit; on seeing this we
ceased firing, so that in 30 minutes after we got fairly along side
the enemy she surrendered, and had not a spar standing, and her
hull below and above water so shattered, that a few more broadsides
must have carried her down.</p>
<p>After informing you that so fine a ship as the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, commanded
by an able and experienced officer, had been totally dismasted,
and otherwise cut to pieces, so as to make her not worth
towing into port, in the short space of 30 minutes, you can have
no doubt of the gallantry and good conduct of the officers and
ship&rsquo;s company I have the honour to command. It only remains,
therefore, for me to assure you, that they all fought with great
bravery; and it gives me great pleasure to say, that from the smallest
boy in the ship to the oldest seaman, not a look of fear was
seen. They all went into action, giving three cheers, and requesting
to be laid close along side the enemy.</p>
<p>Enclosed I have the honour to send you a list of killed and
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
wounded on board the <i>Constitution</i>, and a report of the damages
she has sustained; also, a list of the killed and wounded on board
the enemy.</p>

<h3 id="c18">Commodore Perry Wins a Victory on Lake Erie</h3>
<p>The naval campaigns of the War of 1812 were fought on the Great
Lakes as well as in the Atlantic. Because British troops were based in
Canada, the northern border of the United States inevitably became a
battle line. Commodore Perry won another important sea victory a
year after the <i>Constitution</i> defeated the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i> when his squadron
defeated and captured a British squadron on Lake Erie. This was the
battle which Perry reported to General William Henry Harrison in his
famous remark: &ldquo;We have met the enemy, and they are ours.&rdquo; In the
two dispatches that follow, Perry gives a full account of the action to
the Secretary of the Navy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> has pleased the Almighty to give to the arms of the United
States a signal victory over their enemies on this lake. The British
squadron, consisting of two ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one
sloop, have this moment surrendered to the force under my command,
after a sharp conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> my last I informed you that we had captured the enemy&rsquo;s
fleet on this lake. I have now the honour to give you the most important
particulars of the action. On the morning of the 10th instant,
at sunrise, they were discovered from Put-In-Bay, when I
lay at anchor with the squadron under my command. We got under
weigh, the wind light at south-west, and stood for them. At 10 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>
the wind hauled to south-east and brought us to windward; formed
the line and bore up. At 15 minutes before 12, the enemy commenced
firing; at 5 minutes before 12, the action commenced on
our part.</p>
<p>Finding their fire very destructive owing to their long guns, and
its being mostly directed at the <i>Lawrence</i>, I made sail, and directed
the other vessels to follow, for the purpose of closing with the enemy.
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
Every brace and bowline being soon shot away, she became
unmanageable, notwithstanding the great exertions of the sailing
master. In this situation, she sustained the action upwards of two
hours within canister distance, until every gun was rendered useless,
and the greater part of her crew either killed or wounded.
Finding she could no longer annoy the enemy, I left her in charge
of Lieutenant Yarnall, who, I was convinced, from the bravery
already displayed by him, would do what would comport with the
honour of the flag.</p>
<p>At half past two, the wind springing up, Captain Elliot was
enabled to bring his vessel, the <i>Niagara</i>, gallantly into close action.
I immediately went on board of her, when he anticipated my wish
by volunteering to bring the schooner which had been kept astern
by the lightness of the wind, into close action. It was with unspeakable
pain that I saw, soon after I got on board the <i>Niagara</i>, the
flag of the <i>Lawrence</i> come down, although I was perfectly sensible
that she had been defended to the last, and that to have continued
to make a show of resistance would have been a wanton
sacrifice of the remains of her brave crew. But the enemy was not
able to take possession of her, and circumstances soon permitted
her flag again to be hoisted.</p>
<p>At 45 minutes past 2, the signal was made for &ldquo;close action.&rdquo;
The <i>Niagara</i> being very little injured, I determined to pass through
the enemy&rsquo;s line, bore up and passed ahead of their two ships and
a brig, giving a raking fire to them from the starboard guns, and
to a large schooner and sloop, from the larboard side, at half pistol
shot distance. The smaller vessels at this time having got within
grape and canister distance, under the direction of Captain Elliot,
and keeping up a well-directed fire, the two ships, a brig, and a
schooner surrendered, a schooner and sloop making a vain attempt
to escape.</p>

<h3 id="c19">The British Burn Washington</h3>
<p>Probably the most humiliating military defeat ever inflicted on the
United States occurred in August, 1814, when British troops marched
into Washington and burned the public buildings. This was a punitive
action designed to teach the Americans a lesson and to demoralize the
country. Official Washington fled at the approach of the British, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
in the following letter Dolly Madison, the President&rsquo;s wife, describes her
activities on the day before and her flight from the White House on
the day of the British invasion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Dear</span> Sister&mdash;My husband left me yesterday morning to join
General Winder. He inquired anxiously whether I had courage or
firmness to remain in the President&rsquo;s house until his return on the
morrow, or succeeding day, and on my assurance that I had no
fear but for him, and the success of our army, he left, beseeching
me to take care of myself, and of the Cabinet papers, public and
private. I have since received two dispatches from him, written
with a pencil. The last is alarming, because he desires I should be
ready at a moment&rsquo;s warning to enter my carriage, and leave the
city; that the enemy seemed stronger than had at first been reported,
and it might happen that they would reach the city with
the intention of destroying it. I am accordingly ready; I have
pressed as many Cabinet papers into trunks as to fill one carriage;
our private property must be sacrificed, as it is impossible to procure
wagons for its transportation. I am determined not to go myself
until I see Mr. Madison safe, so that he can accompany me,
as I hear of much hostility towards him. Disaffection stalks around
us. My friends and acquaintances are all gone, even Colonel C.
with his hundred, who were stationed as a guard in this inclosure.
French John [<i>a faithful servant</i>], with his usual activity and resolution,
offers to spike the cannon at the gate, and lay a train of
powder, which would blow up the British, should they enter the
house. To the last proposition I positively object, without being able
to make him understand why all advantages in war may not be
taken.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday Morning</i>, twelve o&rsquo;clock. Since sunrise I have
been turning my spy-glass in every direction, and watching with
unwearied anxiety, hoping to discover the approach of my dear
husband and his friends; but, alas! I can descry only groups of
military, wandering in all directions, as if there was a lack of arms,
or of spirit to fight for their own fireside.</p>
<p>Three o&rsquo;clock. Will you believe it, my sister? we have had a
battle, or skirmish, near Bladensburg, and here I am still, within
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
sound of the cannon! Mr. Madison comes not. May God protect us!
Two messengers covered with dust come to bid me fly; but here
I mean to wait for him.... At this late hour a wagon has been
procured, and I have had it filled with plate and the most valuable
portable articles belonging to the house. Whether it will reach its
destination, the Bank of Maryland, or fall into the hands of British
soldiery, events must determine. Our kind friend, Mr. Carroll, has
come to hasten my departure, and in a very bad humor with me,
because I insist on waiting until the large picture of General Washington
is secured, and it requires to be unscrewed from the wall.
This process was found too tedious for these perilous moments; I
have ordered the frame to be broken, and the canvas taken out.
It is done! and the precious portrait placed in the hands of two
gentlemen of New York, for safe keeping. And now, dear sister, I
must leave this house, or the retreating army will make me a prisoner
in it by filling up the road I am directed to take. When I
shall again write to you, or where I shall be tomorrow, I cannot
tell!</p>

<h3 id="c20">The British Burn Washington: George Gleig</h3>
<p>British General Robert Ross landed with about four thousand men
and marched into Washington without much opposition. The scene that
took place during the burning is vividly described by a British officer,
George Gleig, in <i>A Narrative of the Campaigns of the British Army</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">While</span> the third brigade was thus employed [<i>burning buildings</i>],
the rest of the army, having recalled its stragglers and removed
the wounded into Bladensburg, began its march towards
Washington. Though the battle was ended by four o&rsquo;clock, the sun
had set before the different regiments were in a condition to move;
consequently this short journey was performed in the dark. The
work of destruction had also begun in the city, before they quitted
their ground; and the blazing of houses, ships, and stores, the report
of exploding magazines, and the crash of falling roofs informed
them, as they proceeded, of what was going forward. You
can conceive nothing finer than the sight which met them as they
drew near to the town. The sky was brilliantly illuminated by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
different conflagrations, and a dark red light was thrown upon the
road, sufficient to permit each man to view distinctly his comrade&rsquo;s
face. Except the burning of St. Sebastian&rsquo;s, I do not recollect to
have witnessed ... a scene more striking or more sublime.</p>
<p>I need scarcely to observe that the consternation of the inhabitants
was complete, and that to them this was a night of terror.
So confident had they been of the success of their troops, that few
of them had dreamed of quitting their houses or abandoning the
city; nor was it till the fugitives from the battle began to rush in,
filling every place as they came with dismay, that the President
himself thought of providing for his safety. That gentleman, as I
was credibly informed, had gone forth in the morning with the
army, and had continued among his troops till the British forces
began to make their appearance. Whether the sight of his enemies
cooled his courage or not, I cannot say, but, according to my informer,
no sooner was the glittering of our arms discernible, than
he began to discover that his presence was more wanted in the
Senate than with the army; and having ridden through the ranks,
and exhorted every man to do his duty, he hurried back to his
own house, that he might prepare a feast for the entertainment
of his officers, when they should return victorious.</p>
<p>For the truth of these details, I will not be answerable; but
this much I know, that the feast was actually prepared, though,
instead of being devoured by American officers, it went to satisfy
the less delicate appetites of a party of English soldiers. When the
detachment sent out to destroy Mr. Madison&rsquo;s house entered his
dining parlor, they found a dinner table spread and covers laid
for forty guests. Several kinds of wine, in handsome cut-glass decanters,
were cooling on the sideboard; plate-holders stood by the
fireplace, filled with dishes and plates; knives, forks, and spoons
were arranged for immediate use; in short, everything was ready
for the entertainment of a ceremonious party. Such were the arrangements
in the dining room, whilst in the kitchen were others
answerable to them in every respect. Spits, loaded with joints of
various sorts, turned before the fire; pots, saucepans, and other
culinary utensils stood upon the grate; and all the other requisites
for an elegant and substantial repast were exactly in a state which
indicated that they had been lately and precipitately abandoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>You will readily imagine that these preparations were beheld
by a party of hungry soldiers with no indifferent eye. An elegant
dinner, even though considerably overdressed, was a luxury to
which few of them, at least for some time back, had been accustomed,
and which, after the dangers and fatigues of the day, appeared
peculiarly inviting. They sat down to it, therefore, not
indeed in the most orderly manner, but with countenances which
would not have disgraced a party of aldermen at a civic feast, and,
having satisfied their appetites with fewer complaints than would
have probably escaped their rival <i>gourmands</i>, and partaken pretty
freely of the wines, they finished by setting fire to the house....</p>
<p>But, as I have just observed, this was a night of dismay to the
inhabitants of Washington. They were taken completely by surprise;
nor could the arrival of the flood be more unexpected to
the natives of the antediluvian world than the arrival of the British
army to them. The first impulse of course tempted them to fly, and
the streets were in consequence crowded with soldiers and senators,
men, women, and children, horses, carriages, and carts loaded
with household furniture, all hastening towards a wooden bridge
which crosses the Potomac. The confusion thus occasioned was
terrible, and the crowd upon the bridge was such as to endanger
its giving way. But Mr. Madison, having escaped among the first,
was no sooner safe on the opposite bank of the river than he gave
orders that the bridge should be broken down; which being
obeyed, the rest were obliged to return and to trust to the clemency
of the victors.</p>
<p>In this manner was the night passed by both parties; and at
daybreak next morning, the light brigade moved into the city,
while the reserve fell back to a height about a half mile in the
rear. Little, however, now remained to be done, because everything
marked out for destruction was already consumed. Of the
Senate house, the President&rsquo;s palace, the barracks, the dockyard,
etc., nothing could be seen except heaps of smoking ruins; and
even the bridge ... was almost wholly demolished.</p>

<h3 id="c21">The Battle of New Orleans</h3>
<p>Despite the general incompetence of the American leadership in
the War of 1812, Andrew Jackson emerged from the campaigns as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
genuine war hero. The Battle of New Orleans, which ironically was
fought after the peace treaty had been signed in Europe, was a
great victory. Jackson&rsquo;s troops, greatly outnumbered, barricaded themselves
behind cotton bales and earthworks and mowed down the British
as they stormed the American positions. In the two selections that follow,
we print first the account of the battle by the British officer George
Gleig and then General Jackson&rsquo;s terse report to the Secretary of War.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>OFFICER GLEIG:</h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> main body armed and moved forward some way in front
of the pickets. There they stood waiting for daylight and listening
with the greatest anxiety for the firing which ought now to be
heard on the opposite bank. But this attention was exerted in vain,
and day dawned upon them long before they desired its appearance.
Nor was Sir Edward Pakenham disappointed in this part of
his plan alone. Instead of perceiving everything in readiness for
the assault, he saw his troops in battle array, indeed, but not a
ladder or fascine [<i>bundle of sticks to fill ditches</i>] upon the field.
The 44th, which was appointed to carry them, had either misunderstood
or neglected their orders and now headed the column
of attack without any means being provided for crossing the enemy&rsquo;s
ditch, or scaling his rampart.</p>
<p>The indignation of poor Pakenham on this occasion may be
imagined, but cannot be described. Galloping towards Colonel
Mullens, who led the 44th, he commanded him instantly to return
with his regiment for the ladders, but the opportunity of planting
them was lost, and though they were brought up, it was only to
be scattered over the field by the frightened bearers. For our
troops were by this time visible to the enemy. A dreadful fire was
accordingly opened upon them, and they were mowed down by
hundreds, while they stood waiting for orders.</p>
<p>Seeing that all his well-laid plans were frustrated, Pakenham
gave the word to advance, and the other regiments, leaving the
44th with the ladders and fascines behind them, rushed on to the
assault. On the left a detachment of the 95th, 21st, and 4th
stormed a three-gun battery and took it. Here they remained for
some time in the expectation of support; but none arriving, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
a strong column of the enemy forming for its recovery, they determined
to anticipate the attack and pushed on. The battery which
they had taken was in advance of the body of the works, being
cut off from it by a ditch, across which only a single plank was
thrown. Along this plank did these brave men attempt to pass; but
being opposed by overpowering numbers, they were repulsed; and
the Americans, in turn, forcing their way into the battery, at length
succeeded in recapturing it with immense slaughter.</p>
<p>On the right, again, the 21st and 4th being almost cut to pieces
and thrown into some confusion by the enemy&rsquo;s fire, the 93d
pushed on and took the lead. Hastening forward, our troops soon
reached the ditch; but to scale the parapet without ladders was
impossible. Some few, indeed, by mounting one upon another&rsquo;s
shoulders, succeeded in entering the works, but these were instantly
overpowered, most of them killed, and the rest taken; while
as many as stood without were exposed to a sweeping fire, which
cut them down by whole companies. It was in vain that the most
obstinate courage was displayed. They fell by the hands of men
whom they absolutely did not see; for the Americans, without so
much as lifting their faces above the rampart, swung their firelocks
by one arm over the wall, and discharged them directly upon their
heads. The whole of the guns, likewise, from the opposite bank,
kept up a well directed and deadly cannonade upon their flank;
and thus were they destroyed without an opportunity being given
of displaying their valour, or obtaining so much as revenge.</p>
<p>Poor Pakenham saw how things were going, and did all that a
General could do to rally his broken troops. Riding towards the
44th which had returned to the ground, but in great disorder, he
called out for Colonel Mullens to advance; but that officer had
disappeared, and was not to be found. He, therefore, prepared to
lead them on himself, and had put himself at their head for that
purpose, when he received a slight wound in the knee from a musket
ball which killed his horse. Mounting another, he again headed
the 44th, when a second ball took effect more fatally, and he
dropped lifeless into the arms of his aide-de-camp.</p>
<p>Nor were Generals Gibbs and Keane inactive. Riding through
the ranks, they strove by all means to encourage the assailants
and recall the fugitives, till at length both were wounded and
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
borne off the field. All was now confusion and dismay. Without
leaders, ignorant of what was to be done, the troops first halted
and then began to retire, till finally the retreat was changed into
a flight, and they quitted the ground in the utmost disorder. But
the retreat was covered in gallant style by the reserve. Making a
forward motion, the 7th and 43d presented the appearance of a
renewed attack; by which the enemy were so much awed,
that they did not venture beyond their lines in pursuit of the
fugitives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="c22">GENERAL JACKSON&rsquo;S REPORT:</h4>
<p><span class="sc">During</span> the days of the 6th and 7th, the enemy had been actively
employed in making preparations for an attack on my lines.
With infinite labour they had succeeded on the night of the 7th,
in getting their boats across from the lake to the river, by widening
and deepening the canal on which they had effected their disembarkation.
It had not been in my power to impede these operations
by a general attack: added to other reasons, the nature of
the troops under my command, mostly militia, rendered it too hazardous
to attempt extensive <i>offensive</i> movements in an open country,
against a numerous and well disciplined army.</p>
<p>Although my forces, as to number, had been increased by the
arrival of the Kentucky division, my strength had received very
little addition; a small portion only of that detachment being provided
with arms. Compelled thus to wait the attack of the enemy,
I took every measure to repel it when it should be made, and to
defeat the object he had in view. General Morgan, with the New
Orleans contingent, the Louisiana militia, and a strong detachment
of the Kentucky troops, occupied an entrenched camp on the opposite
side of the river, protected by strong batteries on the bank,
erected and superintended by Commodore Patterson.</p>
<p>In <i>my</i> encampment everything was ready for action, when,
early in the morning of the 8th, the enemy after throwing a heavy
shower of bombs and congreve rockets, advanced their columns
on my right and left, to storm my entrenchments. I cannot speak
sufficiently in praise of the firmness and deliberation with which
my whole line received their approach&mdash;<i>more</i> could not have
been expected from veterans inured to war. For an hour the fire
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
of the small arms was as incessant and severe as can be imagined.
The artillery, too, directed by officers who displayed equal skill
and courage, did great execution.</p>
<p>Yet the columns of the enemy continued to advance with a
firmness which reflects upon them the greatest credit. Twice the
column which approached me on my left, was repulsed by the
troops of General Carroll, those of General Coffee, and a division
of the Kentucky militia, and twice they formed again and renewed
the assault. At length, however, cut to pieces, they fled in confusion
from the field, leaving it covered with their dead and
wounded.</p>
<p>The loss which the enemy sustained on this occasion, cannot
be estimated at less than 1500 in killed, wounded and prisoners.
[<i>The British actually lost over 2,000. American casualties: 8
killed, 13 wounded.</i>] Upwards of three hundred have already been
delivered over for burial; and my men are still engaged in picking
them up within my lines and carrying them to the point where
the enemy are to receive them. This is in addition to the dead
and wounded whom the enemy have been enabled to carry from
the field, during and since the action, and to those who have since
died of the wounds they received. We have taken about 500 prisoners,
upwards of 300 of whom are wounded, and a great part
of them mortally. My loss has not exceeded, and I believe has not
amounted to, 10 killed and as many wounded....</p>

<p>Incidentally, this battle was the last time that British and American
troops ever fought each other. The next time they met on the field of
battle they were allies in World War I.</p>

<p>James Monroe was the last of the quartet of Virginia Presidents
which had begun with George Washington. He was elected after serving
as Madison&rsquo;s Secretary of State, but before that he had fought in
the Revolution, sat in the Continental Congress, been a Senator, a governor,
and a minister to France. His term as President is known as the
Era of Good Feeling because of the absence of serious problems to
divide the country. It was a period of rapid growth as settlers pushed
west and the beginnings of the industrial revolution began to change
the East.</p>
<p>During the early decades of the nineteenth century the wilderness
across the Allegheny Mountains began to fill up with farmers. Throughout
Jefferson&rsquo;s administration there were occasional skirmishes with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Indians, but gradually the Indians were pushed out of their traditional
hunting grounds. While Madison was President, the Shawnee chief Tecumseh,
who had attempted to organize Indian resistance, was crushed
by William Henry Harrison in the Battle of Tippecanoe. Meantime, Ohio
had become a state in 1803, and in 1816, the year that James
Monroe was elected President, Indiana was admitted to the Union. Two
years later, Illinois joined the growing Union.</p>
<p>In the selections reprinted in this part of <i>The Jeffersonians</i> we have
chosen four pieces that show various aspects of life in the Mississippi

<p>William Cooper Howells, the author of the next selection, was the

<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">One</span> of the gatherings for joint work, which has totally disappeared
from the agriculture of modern times, and one that was
always a jolly kind of affair, was the cornhusking. It was a sort
of harvest home in its department, and it was the more jolly because
it was a gathering with very little respect to persons, and
embraced in the invitation men and big boys, with the understanding
that no one would be unwelcome. There was always a good
supper served at the husking, and as certainly a good appetite to
eat it with. It came at a plentiful season, when the turkeys and
chickens were fat, and a fat pig was at hand, to be flanked on the
table with good bread in various forms, turnips and potatoes from
the autumn stores, apple and pumpkin pies, good coffee and the
like. And the cooking was always well done, and all in such bountiful
abundance that no one feared to eat, while many a poor fellow
was certain of a square meal by being present at a husking.
You were sure to see the laboring men of the vicinity out, and
the wives of a goodly number of farm hands would be on hand to
help in the cooking and serving at the table. The cornhusking has
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
been discontinued because the farmers found out that it was less
trouble to husk it in the field, direct from the stalk, than to gather
in the husk and go over it again. But in that day they did not
know that much and therefore took the original method of managing
their corn crop, which was this: as soon as the grain began
to harden they would cut the stalks off just above the ears and
save these tops for fodder, and if they had time they stripped all
the blades off the stalks below the ears, which made very nice
though costly feed. Then, as barn room was not usually over
plenty, they made a kind of frame of poles, as for a tent, and
thatched it, sides and top, with the corn tops placed with the tassel
downward, so as to shed the rain and snow. This was called the
fodder-house and was built in the barnyard. Inside they would
store the blades in bundles, the husks, and the pumpkins that were
saved for use in the winter. The fodder-house was commonly made
ten feet high and as long as was necessary, and it was used up
through the winter by feeding the fodder to the cattle, beginning
at the back, which would be temporarily closed by a few bundles
of the tops. It would thus serve as a protection for what might be
stored in it till all was used up. The fodder-house was, of all things,
a favorite place for the children to hide in and play. When the
season for gathering the corn came the farmers went through the
fields and pulled off the ears and husks together, throwing them
upon the ground in heaps, whence they were hauled into the barnyard
and there piled up in a neat pile of convenient length, according
to the crop, and say four or five feet high, rising to a
sharp peak from a base of about six feet. Care was taken to make
this pile of equal width and height from end to end, so that it
would be easily and fairly divided in the middle by a rail laid
upon it.</p>
<p>When the husking party had assembled they were all called
out into line, and two fellows, mostly ambitious boys, were chosen
captains. These then chose their men, each calling out one of the
crowd alternately, till all were chosen. Then the heap was divided,
by two judicious chaps walking solemnly along the ridge of the
heap of corn, and deciding where the dividing rail was to be laid,
and, as this had to be done by starlight or moonlight at best, it
took considerable deliberation, as the comparative solidity of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
ends of the heap and the evenness of it had to be taken into account.
This done, the captains placed a good steady man at each
side of the rail, who made it a point to work through and cut the
heap in two as soon as possible; and then the two parties fell to
husking, all standing with the heap in front of them, and throwing
the husked corn on to a clear place over the heap, and the husks
behind them. From the time they began till the corn was all husked
at one end, there would be steady work, each man husking all
the corn he could, never stopping except to take a pull at the
stone jug of inspiration that passed occasionally along the line;
weak lovers of the stuff were sometimes overcome, though it was
held to be a disgraceful thing to take too much. The captains would
go up and down their lines and rally their men as if in a battle,
and the whole was an exciting affair.</p>
<p>As soon as one party got done, they raised a shout, and hoisting
their captain on their shoulders, carried him over to the other
side with general cheering. Then would come a little bantering
talk and explanation why the defeated party lost, and all would
turn to and husk up the remnants of the heap. All hands would
then join to carry the husks into the fodder-house. The shout at
hoisting the captain was the signal for bringing the supper on the
table, and the huskers and the supper met soon after. These gatherings
often embraced forty or fifty men. If the farmhouse was
small it would be crowded, and the supper would be managed by
repeated sittings at the table. At a large house there was less crowding
and more fun, and if, as was often the case, some occasion
had been given for an assemblage of the girls of the neighborhood,
and particularly if the man that played the fiddle should attend,
after the older men had gone, there was very apt to be a good
time. There was a tradition that the boys who accidentally husked
a red ear and saved it would be entitled to a kiss from somebody.
But I never knew it to be necessary to produce a red ear to secure
a kiss where there was a disposition to give or take one.</p>

<h3 id="c25">Religion in Tennessee</h3>
<p>Religion played an important part in the lives of frontier settlers.
Instead of the stern Puritanism of colonial New England, the religion of
the West in the early years of the last century was highly evangelistic.
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
By this time, the Methodist movement had made a large number of
converts and was particularly strong on the frontier. One tireless Methodist
preacher was Lorenzo Dow, often known as &ldquo;Crazy Dow,&rdquo; who
traveled throughout the United States during a long ministry. Though
he lived until 1834, the selection that follows comes from his journal
of 1804, when he visited Tennessee at the age of 27. He was then
traveling about ten thousand miles a year by horse and on foot over
trails and primitive roads. This selection is particularly interesting for its
account of a backwoods religious fervor, almost a physical affliction,
described by Dow as the <i>jerks</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Next</span> day I rode forty-five miles in company with Dr. Nelson
across the dismal Allegheny mountains by the warm springs, and
on the way a young man, a traveller, came in (where I breakfasted
gratis at an inn) and said that he had but three sixteenths
of a dollar left, having been robbed of seventy-one dollars on the
way; and he being far from home, I gave him half of what I had
with me.</p>
<p>My horse having a navel gall come on his back, I sold him
with the saddle, bridle, cloak and blanket, etc., on credit for about
three fourths of the value, with uncertainty whether I should ever
be paid: thus I crossed the river French Broad in a canoe and
set out for my appointment; but fearing I should be behind the
time, I hired a man (whom I met on the road with two horses) to
carry me five miles in haste for three shillings; which left me but
one sixteenth of a dollar. In our speed he observed there was a
nigh way by which I could clamber the rocks and cut off some
miles: so we parted; he having not gone two thirds of the way
yet insisted on the full sum.</p>
<p>I took to my feet the nigh way as fast as I could pull on, as
intricate as it was, and came to a horrid ledge of rocks on the
bank of the river where there was no such thing as going round;
and to clamber over would be at the risk of my life, as there was
danger of slipping into the river. However, being unwilling to disappoint
the people, I pulled off my shoes, and with my handkerchief
fastened them about my neck, and creeping upon my hands
and feet with my fingers and toes in the cracks of the rocks with
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
difficulty I got safe over. In about four miles I came to a house
and hired a woman to take me over the river in a canoe, for my
remaining money and a pair of scissors; the latter of which was
the chief object with her: so our extremities are other&rsquo;s opportunities.
Thus with difficulty I got to my appointment in Newport in
time.</p>
<p>I had heard about a singularity called the <i>jerks</i> or <i>jerking exercise</i>,
which appeared first near Knoxville in August last, to the
great alarm of the people; which reports at first I considered as
vague and false. But at length, like the Queen of Sheba, I set out
to go and see for myself and sent over these appointments into
this country accordingly.</p>
<p>When I arrived in sight of this town, I saw hundreds of people
collected in little bodies; and observing no place appointed for
meeting, before I spoke to any, I got on a log and gave out an
hymn; which caused them to assemble round, in solemn attentive
silence. I observed several involuntary motions in the course of
the meeting, which I considered as a specimen of the jerks. I rode
seven miles behind a man across streams of water and held meeting
in the evening, being ten miles on my way.</p>
<p>In the night I grew uneasy, being twenty-five miles from my
appointment for next morning at eleven o&rsquo;clock; I prevailed on a
young man to attempt carrying me with horses until day, which
he thought was impracticable, considering the darkness of the
night and the thickness of the trees. Solitary shrieks were heard in
these woods, which he told me were said to be the cries of murdered
persons. At day we parted, being still seventeen miles from
the spot, and the ground covered with a white frost. I had not
proceeded far before I came to a stream of water from the springs
of the mountain, which made it dreadful cold; in my heated state
I had to wade this stream five times in the course of about an hour,
which I perceived so affected my body that my strength began
to fail. Fears began to arise that I must disappoint the people, till I
observed some fresh tracks of horses which caused me to exert
every nerve to overtake them in hopes of aid or assistance on my
journey, and soon I saw them on an eminence. I shouted for them
to stop, till I came up; they inquired what I wanted; I replied I
had heard there was meeting at Seversville by a stranger and was
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
going to it. They replied that they had heard that a crazy man was
to hold forth there and were going also; and perceiving that I was
weary, they invited me to ride, and soon our company was increased
to forty or fifty who fell in with us on the road, from different
plantations. At length I was interrogated, whether I knew
anything about the preacher. I replied. &ldquo;I have heard a good deal
about him, and have heard him preach, but I have no great opinion
of him.&rdquo; And thus the conversation continued for some miles
before they found me out, which caused some color and smiles in
the company.</p>
<p>Thus I got on to meeting, and after taking a cup of tea gratis,
I began to speak to a vast audience; and I observed about thirty
to have the <i>jerks</i>. Though they strove to keep still as they could,
these emotions were involuntary, and irresistible, as any unprejudiced
eye might discern. Lawyer Porter (who had come a considerable
distance) got his heart touched under the word and being
informed how I came to meeting, voluntarily lent me a horse to
ride near one hundred miles and gave me a dollar, though he had
never seen me before.</p>
<p>Hence to Marysville, where I spoke to about one thousand five
hundred; and many appeared to feel the word, but about fifty felt
the jerks. At night I lodged with one of the Nicholites, a kind of
Quakers who do not feel free to wear coloured clothes. I spoke
to a number of people at his house that night. Whilst at tea I
observed his daughter (who sat opposite to me at the table) to
have the jerks; and dropped the tea cup from her hand in the violent
agitation. I said to her, &ldquo;Young woman, what is the matter?&rdquo;
She replied, &ldquo;I have got the jerks.&rdquo; I asked her how long she had
it? She observed &ldquo;a few days&rdquo; and that it had been the means of
the awakening and conversion of her soul by stirring her up to
serious consideration about her careless state, etc.</p>
<p>Sunday, February 19th, I spoke in Knoxville to hundreds more
than could get into the court house, the Governor being present.
About one hundred and fifty appeared to have jerking exercise,
among whom was a circuit preacher (Johnson) who had opposed
them a little before, but he now had them powerfully; and I believe
he would have fallen over three times had not the auditory
been so crowded that he could not, unless he fell perpendicularly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>After meeting I rode eighteen miles to hold meeting at night.
The people of this settlement were mostly Quakers; and they had
said (as I was informed) the Methodists and Presbyterians have
the <i>jerks</i> because they <i>sing</i> and <i>pray</i> so much, but we are a still
peaceable people, wherefore we do not have them. However,
about twenty of them came to meeting, to hear one, as was said,
somewhat in a Quaker line, but their usual stillness and silence
was interrupted; for about a dozen of them had the jerks as keen
and as powerful as any I had seen, so as to have occasioned a kind
of grunt or groan when they would jerk. It appears that many
have undervalued the great revival, and attempted to account for
it altogether on natural principles; therefore it seems to me (from
the best judgment I can form) that God hath seen proper to take
this method, to convince people, that he will work in a way to
show his power; and sent the <i>jerks</i> as a sign of the times, partly
in judgment for the people&rsquo;s unbelief, and yet as a mercy to convict
people of divine realities.</p>

<h3 id="c26">Davy Crockett Runs for Office</h3>
<p>Davy Crockett, who describes himself as an &ldquo;ignorant backwoods
bearhunter,&rdquo; was just another poor frontier boy until he got into politics.
Then he served in the state legislature and later in Congress. He
became the fair-haired boy of Whig politicians when he broke with
Andrew Jackson, his fellow Tennessee Democrat. Subsequently, his backwoods
humor, tall tales, and picturesque personality were exploited by
Whig journalists, and Crockett became a sort of folklore hero.</p>
<p>But Tennessee Democrats would not tolerate his desertion of their
party and turned him out of office. After that, he went to Texas and
died, as everyone remembers, during the heroic defense of the Alamo.
The following selection is taken from <i>A Narrative of the Life of Davy
Crockett</i>, which passes for his autobiography but which undoubtedly
was ghostwritten for him. This account describes with typical frontier
exaggeration Crockett&rsquo;s first campaign for office.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> a little time I was asked to offer for the Legislature in the
counties of Lawrence and Heckman. I offered my name in the
month of February, and started about the first of March with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
drove of horses to the lower part of the State of North Carolina.
This was in the year 1821, and I was gone upwards of three
months. I returned, and set out electioneering, which was a brand-fire
new business to me. It now became necessary that I should
tell the people something about the government, and an eternal
sight of other things that I knowed nothing more about than I did
about Latin, and law, and such things as that. I have said before
that in those days none of us called General Jackson the government
[<i>Jackson was not yet President, and Crockett was still a Democrat</i>],
nor did he seem in as fair a way to become so as I do now;
but I knowed so little about it, that if any one had told me he
was &ldquo;the government,&rdquo; I should have believed it, for I had never
read even a newspaper in my life, or anything else, on the subject.
But over all my difficulties, it seems to me I was born for luck,
though it would be hard for any one to guess what sort. I will,
however, explain that hereafter.</p>
<p>I went first into Heckman county, to see what I could do among
the people as a candidate. Here they told me that they wanted to
move their town nearer to the centre of the county, and I must
come out in favor of it. There&rsquo;s no devil if I knowed what this
meant, or how the town was to be moved; and so I kept dark,
going on the identical same plan that I now find is called &ldquo;<i>noncommittal</i>.&rdquo;
About this time there was a great squirrel hunt on
Duck River, which was among my people. They were to hunt two
days; then to meet and count the scalps, and have a big barbecue,
and what might be called a tip-top country frolic. The dinner, and
a general treat, was all to be paid for by the party having taken
the fewest scalps. I joined one side, taking the place of one of the
hunters, and got a gun ready for the hunt. I killed a great many
squirrels, and when we counted scalps, my party was victorious.</p>
<p>The company had every thing to eat and drink that could be
furnished in so new a country, and much fun and good humor
prevailed. But before the regular frolic commenced, I mean the
dancing, I was called on to make a speech as a candidate; which
was a business I was as ignorant of as an outlandish Negro.</p>
<p>A public document I had never seen, nor did I know there
were such things; and how to begin I couldn&rsquo;t tell. I made many
apologies, and tried to get off, for I know&rsquo;d I had a man to run
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
against who could speak prime, and I know&rsquo;d, too, that I wasn&rsquo;t
able to shuffle and cut with him. He was there, and knowing my
ignorance as well as I did myself, he also urged me to make a
speech. The truth is, he thought my being a candidate was a mere
matter of sport; and didn&rsquo;t think for a moment that he was in any
danger from an ignorant backwoods bear hunter. But I found I
couldn&rsquo;t get off, and so I determined just to go ahead, and leave
it to chance what I should say. I got up and told the people I
reckoned they know&rsquo;d what I come for, but if not, I could tell
them. I had come for their votes, and if they didn&rsquo;t watch mighty
close I&rsquo;d get them too. But the worst of all was, that I could not
tell them anything about government. I tried to speak about something,
and I cared very little what, until I choked up as bad as
if my mouth had been jamm&rsquo;d and cramm&rsquo;d chock full of dry
mush. There the people stood, listening all the while, with their
eyes, mouths, and ears all open, to catch every word....</p>
<p>At last I told them I was like a fellow I had heard of not long
before. He was beating on the head of an empty barrel near the
road-side, when a traveler, who was passing along, asked him
what he was doing that for? The fellow replied that there was
some cider in that barrel a few days before, and he was trying to
see if there was any then, but if there was he couldn&rsquo;t get at it. I
told them that there had been a little bit of speech in me a while
ago, but I believed I couldn&rsquo;t get it out. They all roared out in a
mighty laugh, and I told some other anecdotes, equally amusing
to them, and believing I had them in a first-rate way, I quit and
got down, thanking the people for their attention. But I took care
to remark that I was as dry as a powder-horn, and that I thought
it was time for us all to wet our whistles a little; and so I put off to
the liquor stand, and was followed by the greater part of the
crowd.</p>
<p>I felt certain this was necessary, for I knowed my competitor
could open government matters to them as easy as he pleased. He
had, however, mighty few left to hear him, as I continued with
the crowd, now and then taking a horn, and telling good-humored
stories, till he was done speaking. I found I was good for the votes
at the hunt, and when we broke up I went on to the town of Vernon,
which was the same [<i>town</i>] they wanted me to move. Here
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
they pressed me again on the subject, and I found I could get
either party by agreeing with them. But I told them I didn&rsquo;t know
whether it would be right or not, and so couldn&rsquo;t promise either
way.</p>
<p>Their court commenced on the next Monday, as the barbecue
was on a Saturday, and the candidates for Governor, and for Congress,
as well as my competitor and myself, all attended.</p>
<p>The thought of having to make a speech made my knees feel
mighty weak, and set my heart to fluttering almost as bad as my
first love scrape with the Quaker&rsquo;s niece. But as good luck would
have it, these big candidates spoke nearly all day, and when they
quit, the people were worn out with fatigue, which afforded me a
good apology for not discussing the government. But I listened
mighty close to them, and was learning pretty fast about political
matters. When they were all done, I got up and told some laughable
story, and quit. I found I was safe in those parts, and so I
went home, and did not go back again till after the election was
over. But to cut this matter short, I was elected, doubling my competitor,
and nine votes over.</p>

<h3 id="c27">Early Days in Illinois</h3>
<p>Morris Birkbeck was an Englishman who came to the United States
and settled in southeastern Illinois where he founded the town of Albion.
His account of the people and life in Illinois in 1817, just before it
became a state, is good reporting. He has a sharp eye for detail, and
because he was fresh from Europe, he sees and records the contrasts
between the Midwestern backwoods and the Old World. The following
selection comes from his book, <i>Notes on a Journey in America, from the
Coast of Virginia to the Territory of Illinois</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>August 1.</i> <span class="sc">Dagley&rsquo;s</span>, twenty miles north of Shawnee Town.
After viewing several beautiful prairies, so beautiful with their surrounding
woods as to seem like the creation of fancy, gardens of
delight in a dreary wilderness, and after losing our horses and
spending two days in recovering them, we took a hunter as our
guide and proceeded across the Little Wabash to explore the country
between that river and the Skillet-fork.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Since we left the Fox settlement, about fifteen miles north of
the Big Prairie, cultivation has been very scanty, many miles intervening
between the little &ldquo;clearings.&rdquo; This may therefore be
truly called a new country.</p>
<p>These lonely settlers are poorly off&mdash;their bread corn must
be ground thirty miles off, requiring three days to carry to the mill
and bring back the small horse-load of three bushels. Articles of
family manufacture are very scanty, and what they purchase is of
the meanest quality and excessively dear: yet they are friendly
and willing to share their simple fare with you. It is surprising how
comfortable they seem, wanting everything. To struggle with privations
has now become the habit of their lives, most of them having
made several successive plunges into the wilderness, and they
begin already to talk of selling their &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; and getting
still farther &ldquo;back&rdquo; on finding that emigrants of another description
are thickening about them.</p>
<p>Our journey across the Little Wabash was a complete departure
from all mark of civilization. We saw no bears, as they are
now buried in the thickets, and seldom appear by day; but, at
every few yards, we saw recent marks of their doings, &ldquo;wallowing&rdquo;
in the long grass or turning over decayed logs in quest of
beetles or worms, in which work the strength of this animal is
equal to that of four men. Wandering without track, where even
the sagacity of our hunter-guide had nearly failed us, we at length
arrived at the cabin of another hunter, where we lodged.</p>
<p>This man and his family are remarkable instances of the effect
on the complexion produced by the perpetual incarceration [<i>imprisonment</i>]
of a thorough woodland life. Incarceration may seem
to be a term less applicable to the condition of a roving backwoodsman
than to any other, and especially unsuitable to the habits
of this individual and his family; for the cabin in which he
entertained us is the third dwelling he has built within the last
twelve months, and a very slender motive would place him in a
fourth before the ensuing winter. In his general habits the hunter
ranges as freely as the beasts he pursues; labouring under no restraint,
his activity is only bounded by his own physical powers:
still he is incarcerated&mdash;&ldquo;Shut from the common air.&rdquo; Buried in
the depth of a boundless forest, the breeze of health never reaches
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
these poor wanderers; the bright prospect of distant hills fading
away into the semblance of clouds, never cheered their sight. They
are tall and pale, like vegetables that grow in a vault, pining for
light....</p>
<p>Our stock of provisions being nearly exhausted, we were anxious
to provide ourselves with a supper by means of our guns, but
we could meet with neither deer nor turkey; however, in our utmost
need, we shot three raccoons, an old one to be roasted for
our dogs and the two young ones to be stewed up daintily for ourselves.
We soon lighted a fire and cooked the old raccoon for
the dogs; but famished as they were, they would not touch it, and
their squeamishness so far abated our relish for the promised stew
that we did not press our complaining landlady to prepare it; and
thus our supper consisted of the residue of our &ldquo;corn&rdquo; bread and
<i>no</i> raccoon. However, we laid our bear skins on the filthy earth
(floor there was none), which they assured us was &ldquo;too damp for
fleas,&rdquo; and wrapped in our blankets slept soundly enough; though
the collops [<i>slices</i>] of venison hanging in comely rows in the smoky
fireplace and even the shoulders put by for the dogs and which
were suspended over our heads would have been an acceptable
prelude to our night&rsquo;s rest, had we been invited to partake of them;
but our hunter and our host were too deeply engaged in conversation
to think of supper. In the morning the latter kindly invited us
to cook some of the collops, which we did by toasting them on a
stick, and he also divided some shoulders among the dogs; so we
all fared sumptuously.</p>
<p>The cabin, which may serve as a specimen of these rudiments
of houses, was formed of round logs with apertures of three or
four inches between. No chimney, but large intervals between the
&ldquo;clapboards&rdquo; for the escape of the smoke. The roof was, however,
a more effectual covering than we have generally experienced, as
it protected us very tolerably from a drenching night. Two bedsteads
of unhewn logs and cleft boards laid across; two chairs, one
of them without a bottom, and a low stool were all the furniture
required by this numerous family. A string of buffalo hide
stretched across the hovel was a wardrobe for their rags; and their
utensils, consisting of a large iron pot, some baskets, the effective
rifle and two that were superannuated [<i>too old to use</i>], stood about
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
in corners, and the fiddle, which was only silent when we were
asleep, hung by them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c28">Ominous Loomings: The Missouri Compromise, 1820</h2>
<p>When the War of 1812 ended, the United States consisted of eighteen
states&mdash;nine free and nine slave. Very soon Indiana was admitted as
a free state, offset by Mississippi as a slave state. It was inevitable
that this precarious balance between the North and the South would
some day cause trouble, and the trouble came very soon. In 1818,
Illinois entered as a free state, and the enabling legislation to admit
Missouri was introduced in Congress in 1819.</p>
<p>The South assumed that Missouri would be a slave state, but a
New York Congressman amended the Missouri statehood bill to provide
for gradual freeing of the slaves there. The South reacted vigorously
to keep from losing its equal representation in the Senate and blocked
passage of the bill. Meanwhile, Alabama came in to balance Illinois,
and there were eleven northern and eleven southern states.</p>
<p>The following year, when Maine applied for admission into the
Union, Henry Clay of Kentucky engineered the famous Missouri Compromise.
This agreement provided that Missouri would come in as a slave
state but that no more slave states would be admitted from territory
north of Missouri&rsquo;s southern boundary. This compromise is important
because it foreshadows the struggle between the North and South that
eventuated in the Civil War a generation later. Although most of the
oratory dealt with the slavery issue, the struggle also concerned the
broader matter of political control in the West.</p>
<h3 id="c29">Representative Arthur Livermore Argues Against Extending Slavery</h3>
<p>The following selections illustrate the debate in Congress over the
Missouri question. The first speech is by Congressman Arthur Livermore
of New Hampshire against the extension of slavery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">I propose</span> to show what slavery is, and to mention a few of
the many evils which follow in its train; and I hope to evince that
we are not bound to tolerate the existence of so disgraceful a state
of things beyond its present extent, and that it would be impolitic
and very unjust to let it spread over the whole face of our Western
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
territory. Slavery in the United States is the condition of man subjected
to the will of a master who can make any disposition of him
short of taking away his life. In those States where it is tolerated,
laws are enacted making it penal to instruct slaves in the art of
reading, and they are not permitted to attend public worship or
to hear the Gospel preached.</p>
<p>Thus the light of science and of religion is utterly excluded
from the mind, that the body may be more easily bowed down to
servitude. The bodies of slaves may, with impunity, be prostituted
to any purpose and deformed in any manner by their owners. The
sympathies of nature in slaves are disregarded; mothers and children
are sold and separated; the children wring their little hands
and expire in agonies of grief, while the bereft mothers commit
suicide in despair. How long will the desire of wealth render us
blind to the sin of holding both the bodies and souls of our fellow-men
in chains!</p>
<p>But, sir, I am admonished of the Constitution, and told that
we cannot emancipate slaves. I know we may not infringe that
instrument, and therefore do not propose to emancipate slaves.
The proposition before us goes only to prevent our citizens from
making slaves of such as have a right to freedom. In the present
slaveholding States let slavery continue, for our boasted Constitution
connives at it; but do not, for the sake of cotton and tobacco,
let it be told to future ages that, while pretending to love liberty,
we have purchased an extensive country to disgrace it with the
foulest reproach of nations.</p>
<p>Our Constitution requires no such thing of us. The ends for
which that supreme law was made are succinctly stated in its preface.
They are, first, to form a more perfect union and insure domestic
tranquility. Will slavery effect this? Can we, sir, by mingling
bond with free, black spirits with white, like Shakespeare&rsquo;s
witches in Macbeth, form a more perfect union and insure domestic
tranquility? Secondly, to establish justice. Is justice to be established
by subjecting half mankind to the will of the other half?
Justice, sir, is blind to colors, and weighs in equal scales the rights
of all men, whether white or black. Thirdly, to provide for the
common defense and secure the blessings of liberty. Does slavery
add anything to the common defense? Sir, the strength of a republic
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
is in the arm of freedom. But, above all things, do the blessings
of liberty consist in slavery?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c30">Senator James Barbour Defends Slavery</h3>
<p>In the second selection we have chosen, Senator James Barbour of
Virginia defends slavery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> gentleman from Pennsylvania asks shall we suffer Missouri
to come into the Union with this savage mark [<i>of slavery</i>] on
her countenance? I appeal to that gentleman to know whether
this be language to address to an American Senate, composed
equally of members from States precisely in that condition that
Missouri would be in, were she to tolerate slavery. Are these sentiments
calculated to cherish that harmony and affection so essential
to any beneficial results from our Union? But, sir, I will not imitate
this course, and I will strive to repress the feeling which such remarks
are calculated to awaken.</p>
<p>... They assure us that they do not mean to touch this property
[<i>slavery</i>] in the old states.... What kind of ethics is this that
is bounded by latitude and longitude, which is inoperative on the
left, but is omnipotent on the right bank of a river? Such a doctrine
is well calculated to excite our solicitude; for, although the
gentlemen who now hold it are sincere in their declarations, and
mean to content themselves with a triumph in this controversy,
what security have we that others will not apply it to the South
generally?</p>
<p>Let it not, however, be supposed that in the abstract I am
advocating slavery. Like all other human things, it is mixed with
good and evil&mdash;the latter, no doubt, preponderating.... Whether
slavery was ordained by God Himself in a particular revelation
to His chosen people, or whether it be merely permitted as a part
of that moral evil which seems to be the inevitable portion of man,
are questions I will not approach; I leave them to the casuists
[<i>debaters</i>] and the divines [<i>preachers</i>]. It is sufficient for us, as
statesmen, to know that it has existed from the earliest ages of
the world, and that to us has been assigned such a portion as, in
reference to their number and the various considerations resulting
from a change of their condition, no remedy, even plausible, has
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
been suggested, though wisdom and benevolence united have unceasingly
brooded over the subject.</p>
<p>However dark and inscrutable may be the ways of heaven,
who is he that arrogantly presumes to arraign [<i>challenge</i>] them?
The same mighty power that planted the greater and the lesser
luminary in the heavens permits on earth the bondsman and the
free. To that Providence, as men and Christians, let us bow. If it
be consistent with His will, in the fullness of time, to break the
fetter of the slave, He will raise up some Moses to be their deliverer.
To him commission will be given to lead them up out of
the land of bondage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c31">Representative James Stevens Argues for the Compromise</h3>
<p>In the final selection James Stevens, Representative from Connecticut,
pleads with Congress to accept the Compromise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">I have</span> listened with pain to the very long, protracted debate
that has been had on this unfortunate question. I call it unfortunate,
sir, because it has drawn forth the worst passions of man
in the course of the discussion....</p>
<p>If the deadliest enemy this country has, or ever had, could
dictate language the most likely to destroy your glory, prosperity,
and happiness, would it not be precisely what has been so profusely
used in this debate&mdash;sectional vaunting?... Indeed, sir,
there is no view of this unhappy division of our country but must
be sickening to the patriot and in direct violation of the dictate
of wisdom, and the last, though not least, important advice of the
Father and Friend of his Country. He forbids the use of the words
Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western, as descriptive of
the various parts of your country.</p>
<p>But, sir, we have now arrived at a point at which every gentleman
agrees something must be done. A precipice lies before us at
which perdition [<i>ruin</i>] is inevitable. Gentlemen on both sides of
this question, and in both Houses, indoors and out of doors, have
evinced a determination that augurs ill of the high destinies of this
country! And who does not tremble for the consequences?...</p>
<p>I wish not to be misunderstood, sir. I don&rsquo;t pretend to say that
in just five calendar months your Union will be at an end;...</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>But, sir, I do say, and, for the verity of the remark, cite the
lamentable history of our own time, that the result of a failure to
compromise at this time, in the way now proposed, or in some
other way satisfactory to both, would be to create ruthless hatred,
irradicable jealousy, and a total forgetfulness of the ardor of patriotism,
to which, as it has heretofore existed, we owe, under
Providence, more solid national glory and social happiness than
ever before was possessed by any people, nation, kindred, or
tongue under Heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c32">The Monroe Doctrine</h2>
<p>Although the United States was mainly concerned with internal problems
during Monroe&rsquo;s presidency, there was one important policy established
during this period in the area of foreign relations. This was the
Monroe Doctrine. It was a statement of policy made by the President
in a message to Congress in 1823, which defined the role of the
United States in international affairs and which, in some respects, is still
vital United States policy.</p>
<p>The Doctrine states that the United States will not tolerate further
foreign colonial expansion by European powers in North or South America.
This policy was necessary because Spain&rsquo;s colonies in Latin America
had recently revolted, and it looked as though the other European
powers might try to reconquer Spain&rsquo;s former colonies. In addition,
Russia was moving southward from Alaska and claiming land down to
the 51st parallel, which would have taken in much of what is now
British Columbia. The Monroe Doctrine also declares that the United
States will not interfere with existing European colonies in the Americas
nor with the internal affairs of European nations. In the following
selection we reprint part of the Monroe Doctrine.</p>
<h3 id="c33">Excerpts from the Monroe Doctrine</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> the wars of the European powers in matters relating to
themselves we have never taken any part, nor does it comport
with our policy so to do. It is only when our rights are invaded or
seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for
our defense. With the movements in this hemisphere we are of
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
necessity more immediately connected, and by causes which must
be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers....</p>
<p>We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations
existing between the United States and those powers to declare
that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their
system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace
and safety. With the existing colonies or dependencies of any
European power we have not interfered and shall not interfere.
But with the Governments who have declared their independence
and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great
consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not
view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling
in any other manner their destiny, by any European power
in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition
toward the United States.</p>
<p>In the war between those new Governments and Spain we
declared our neutrality at the time of their recognition, and to this
we have adhered, and shall continue to adhere, provided no
change shall occur which, in the judgment of the competent authorities
of this Government, shall make a ... change on the
part of the United States indispensable to their security....</p>
<p>Our policy in regard to Europe, which was adopted at an early
stage of the wars which have so long agitated that quarter of the
globe, nevertheless remains the same, which is, not to interfere in
the internal concerns of any of its powers; to consider the government
<i>de facto</i> [<i>actually ruling</i>] as the legitimate government for
us; to cultivate friendly relations with it, and to preserve those relations
by a frank, firm, and manly policy, meeting in all instances
the just claims of every power, submitting to injuries from none.
But in regard to those continents circumstances are eminently and
conspicuously different.</p>
<p>It is impossible that the allied powers should extend their political
system to any portion of either continent [<i>North or South
America</i>] without endangering our peace and happiness; nor can
anyone believe that our southern brethren, if left to themselves,
would adopt it of their own accord. It is equally impossible, therefore,
that we should behold such interposition in any form with
indifference.</p>

<p class="caption">John Quincy Adams</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c34">Lighthouses in the Sky</h2>
<p>John Quincy Adams, who succeeded James Monroe as President
in 1825, was the son of John Adams, the second President. He too had
served a long apprenticeship in government, having been Senator, minister
to Great Britain and Russia, and Secretary of State. Although he
served only one term and was defeated for re-election by Andrew
Jackson, he was a forward-looking President. We illustrate his interest
in science and the internal development of the United States by a portion
of his first message to Congress. He begins with a plea that the
object of government is to improve the lot of the people. He favors
roads and canals, but even more, moral and intellectual improvements.</p>
<h3 id="c35">Excerpts from Adams&rsquo; First Message to Congress</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Upon</span> this first occasion of addressing the Legislature of the
Union, with which I have been honored, in presenting to their
view the execution so far as it has been effected of the measures
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
sanctioned by them for promoting the internal improvement of our
country, I can not close the communication without recommending
to their calm and persevering consideration the general principle
in a more enlarged extent....</p>
<p>Among the first, perhaps the very first, instrument for the improvement
of the conditions of men is knowledge, and to the acquisition
of much of the knowledge adapted to the wants, the comforts,
and enjoyments of human life public institutions and seminaries
of learning are essential. So convinced of this was the first
of my predecessors in this office [<i>George Washington</i>], now
first in the memory, as, living, he was first in the hearts, of our
countrymen, that once and again in his addresses to the Congresses
with whom he co-operated in the public service he earnestly recommended
the establishment of seminaries of learning, to prepare
for all the emergencies of peace and war&mdash;a national university
and a military academy. With respect to the latter, had he lived
to the present day, in turning his eyes to the institution at West
Point he would have enjoyed the gratification of his most earnest
wishes; but in surveying the city which has been honored with his
name he would have seen the spot of earth which he had destined
and bequeathed to the use and benefit of his country as the site
for an university still bare and barren.</p>
<p>In assuming her station among the civilized nations of the
earth it would seem that our country had contracted the engagement
to contribute her share of mind, of labor, and of expense to
the improvement of those parts of knowledge which lie beyond
the reach of individual acquisition, and particularly to geographical
and astronomical science. Looking back to the history only of
the half century since the declaration of our independence, and
observing the generous emulation with which the Governments of
France, Great Britain, and Russia have devoted the genius, the
intelligence, the treasures of their respective nations to the common
improvement of the species in these branches of science, is
it not incumbent upon us to inquire whether we are not bound by
obligations of a high and honorable character to contribute our
portion of energy and exertion to the common stock?...</p>
<p>In inviting the attention of Congress to the subject of internal
improvements upon a view thus enlarged it is not my design to
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
recommend the equipment of an expedition for circumnavigating
the globe for purposes of scientific research and inquiry. We have
objects of useful investigation nearer home, and to which our cares
may be more beneficially applied. The interior of our own territories
has yet been very imperfectly explored. Our coasts along
many degrees of latitude upon the shores of the Pacific Ocean,
though much frequented by our spirited commercial navigators,
have been barely visited by our public ships....</p>
<p>The establishment of an uniform standard of weights and
measures was one of the specific objects contemplated in the formation
of our Constitution, and to fix that standard was one of
the powers delegated by express terms in that instrument to Congress.
The Governments of Great Britain and France have scarcely
ceased to be occupied with inquiries and speculations on the same
subject since the existence of our Constitution, and with them it
has expanded into profound, laborious, and expensive researches
into the figure of the earth and the comparative length of the pendulum
vibrating seconds in various latitudes from the equator to
the pole....</p>
<p>Connected with the establishment of an university, or separate
from it, might be undertaken the erection of an astronomical observatory,
with provision for the support of an astronomer, to be
in constant attendance of observation upon the phenomena of the
heavens, and for the periodical publication of his observations. It
is with no feeling of pride as an American that the remark may
be made that on the comparatively small territorial surface of Europe
there are existing upward of 130 of these light-houses of the
skies, while throughout the whole American hemisphere there is
not one. If we reflect a moment upon the discoveries which in the
last four centuries have been made in the physical constitution of
the universe by the means of these buildings and of observers stationed
in them, shall we doubt of their usefulness to every nation?
And while scarcely a year passes over our heads without bringing
some new astronomical discovery to light, which we must fain receive
at second hand from Europe, are we not cutting ourselves
off from the means of returning light for light while we have neither
observatory nor observer upon our half of the globe and the earth
revolves in perpetual darkness to our unsearching eyes?</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
